Hey everyone, Looks like I finally got some new goodies for Yuki. 

My buddy sold me a Type-x cluster he had laying around. These are pretty hard to come by because they only came on the 96-98 180sx's in Japan, so i'm pretty happy I scored one so easily. lol However, I'm probably going to replace the Carbon Fiber trim panel with just a standard black one. 

To get this thing to work, apparently I need an S14 temp and speed sensor. The plugs on the back are different, but according to a few threads i've read over on zilvia there's some 95 Maxima plugs that will work. After that its just a matter of putting the wiring together. I Also found out, to convert the KMH to MPH I need to solder in a resister to the back of the circuit board. So, nothing too difficult.

I think this will be a nice winter project for me to tackle from inside the warm house instead of being out in the cold garage/shop like last year. haha :p
