Hey everyone, Just thought I'd share a quick update on the new Type-x Lip I got for Yuki. It's made out of FRP from a guy over on zilvia named CrimsonRockett. The quality is awesome, and from what i've seen fitment is spot on!(I've still yet to test fit it on my car.) He was able to have a mold done using his OEM Polyeurathane one.

Downside however, is the lip got a slight crack from shipping. So, I'll probably claim it through USPS and get it patched up.
