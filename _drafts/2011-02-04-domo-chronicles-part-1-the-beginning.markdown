<p>yosh! well since domo factor is starved for motorsports content I figured I’ll cook this up and see what everybody thinks. Everyone including my friends locally have been wanting to see pics of my car that I’m currently building. I kind of wanted to keep everything a deep and dark secret then unveil everything once it’s all finished. but, I’ll give the people what they want. haha Project Midnight will be a collection of parts of me explaining my journey into motorsports, the current car I’m building. and even stuff from after it’s build. basically just a journal..but.. in documentary/blog format I guess… lol Anyways, First off, it’s impossible to figure out where your going, without first taking a look back to see what got you there. So, I will give you guys a look into what made me get into motorsports, and then the first REAL car I had gotten. lol hopefully you enjoy!<img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile2.png" /></p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/domo1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="domo1" border="0" alt="domo1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/domo1.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <!--more-->  <p><strong><u><font size="3">Origins</font></u></strong></p>  <p><font size="2">Well, I guess this is the part where I’m supposed to talk about how I watched this one Iconic video, of drifting or circuit racing, and that caught my eye ever since. But, to be perfectly honest….. I don’t actually remember what sparked my interest. All I know is one moment, I had thought it was interesting, and then the next I really REALLY wanted a car of my own, and to learn more about cars and motorsports. I do remember though, the first time I saw drifting online I had thought the car was gonna go flying off the corner, and then the unthinkable happened. While I thought drifting was amazing, I didn’t go crazy about it at first like some people now days. Initially I was interested in grip racing and circuit stuff.</font></p>  <p>I think initially, the interest sparked when I used to live in Hawai’i.(side note, my dad’s retired Navy, so I lived in a lot of different places). to prevent confusion, here’s a list of place’s that I’ve lived in order up until now.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&#160; 1. San Fransisco,WA- born      <br />&#160; 2. Escondido,CA- still really little       <br />&#160; 3. Silverdale,WA- Kindergarden       <br />&#160; 4. Marysville,WA- 1st and 2nd grade       <br />&#160; 5. Arlington,wa- 3rd through 7th grade       <br />&#160; 6. Honolulu,HI- 8 and 9th grade       <br />&#160; 7. San Diego,CA- 10th and 11th grade       <br />&#160; 8. Marysville,WA- 12th grade       <br />9. Mukilteo,WA- current, college in Everett,WA</p> </blockquote>  <p>So, basically I’ve moved…..A LOT. Anyways, like I was saying, back when I was in hawaii I was really into bikes for some reason. Crotch rockets to be more specific. I’m not sure why but I just really liked them. Even now I think they’re nice, but I probably won’t get one until later on when I can afford it. lol </p>  <p>Once I got into San Diego, something switched on inside of me. All of a sudden I Loved everything about cars and couldn’t get enough. here’s a random pic of me at HIN in san diego back in like 07 I think.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_5b89a1f380ee4e6b9f943b35da30b39b.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_5b89a1f380ee4e6b9f943b35da30b39b" border="0" alt="l_5b89a1f380ee4e6b9f943b35da30b39b" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_5b89a1f380ee4e6b9f943b35da30b39b.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>note my super enthusiastic pose as I met current Formula D drivers Calvin Wan, and Chris Forsburg.(if anybody can fill me in on the the guy in the left is that’d be great.. as I have no clue. lol)</p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3"></font></u></strong></p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3">The First</font></u></strong></p>  <p>It was shortly then that once I got my drivers permit, I began searching with my dad for a car. At one point I came really close to getting a 98 S14(240sx) in dark forest green with white leather interior. but sadly, the price was a bit steep. in the end, I ended up getting my dad’s old car. Behold! The Suzuki Sidekick in all it’s glory!!&gt;_&lt;</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sidekick_pose.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="sidekick_pose" border="0" alt="sidekick_pose" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/sidekick_pose.jpg" width="504" height="378" /></a></p>  <p>awwww yyyeaaah, gotta love those wheels. lol I actually took if offroading a few times and it was a blast! lol althought before I knew anything about power steering I remember telling me dad at one point “ I can’t figure out why this thing is so hard to park now. a few months ago it was fine, but now I feel like I’m parking a cadillac.” He just laughed then explained what power steering fluid was. lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l" border="0" alt="l" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>I remember when I was first given the car, I had thought that the headlights reminded me of an R31/R32. lol so maybe deep down I thought that it was. hehe</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3">The Second</font></u></strong></p>  <p>Once I started my senior year of high school, my dad was kind enough to give me my graduation present early. So, it was at that point when I really started looking for a fun/sporty car. up until that point I had been containing so much anticipation of what it’d be like to drive a REAL car. not some SUV, or front wheel drive sedan. It was then that I struck the motherload or restored 240’s and just in the nick of time. As I got my second car, but first real run car from this older guy that restore’s 240’s to the point they look like they rolled off the show room floor. Case in point? My first 1993 240sx that had 90,000 miles on the motor, and the upholstery had been completely re-done. I’ll let you oogle over the pics riiiighht abbboouut….now!</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_dd6bd3de52e5fbe90d2095346d92c890.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_dd6bd3de52e5fbe90d2095346d92c890" border="0" alt="l_dd6bd3de52e5fbe90d2095346d92c890" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_dd6bd3de52e5fbe90d2095346d92c890.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>here’s the day I brought her home^_^ full stock 4x4 status, and stock automatic KA. lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_8de7a406ff9ce5a62cfe388bd0978269.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_8de7a406ff9ce5a62cfe388bd0978269" border="0" alt="l_8de7a406ff9ce5a62cfe388bd0978269" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_8de7a406ff9ce5a62cfe388bd0978269.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>wewt! jdm tyte ford explorer floor mats! <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile2.png" /></p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l-2.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l (2)" border="0" alt="l (2)" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l-2.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>minty fresh stock KA w/ 90k miles and in auto. this is when I actually didn’t mind driving in traffic.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l-1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l (1)" border="0" alt="l (1)" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l-1.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>rollin to the first day of my senior year in a new high school in style. lol</p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3"></font></u></strong></p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3">Modifications</font></u></strong></p>  <p>well, as far as mods go, I didn’t really do much to this car.&#160; It was right around this time when I was in high school though that I met one of my really good friends Ricky Henderson. It was totally by random, because I was looking into getting a 5 speed swap done on my car, and then I randomly found his shop <a href="http://divinedrift.com" target="_blank">Kami Dori</a> on myspace. After initially getting the 5speed swap done, I went back time and time again, and we’ve been friend’s ever since. It’s kind of funny how much stuff people have in common when they randomly meet each other. But, much props goes to him as he’s taught me LOADS about car and motorsports stuff in general. I honestly think that I wouldn’t know anywhere near as much as I do today without his help. </p>  <p>Since this was my daily driver for school, and work I didn’t do much to it. I managed to get my 5-speed swap from ricky, Injen cold air intake, Megan Racing 2.5” exhaust, some Megan coilovers, XXR 002 wheels, nissan sentra/pathfinder fog lights, 97’ Infiniti Q45 brakes and of course my domo drift charm.lol </p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3" border="0" alt="l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg" width="504" height="337" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s a pic from when I was at an auto-x event earlier last year.</p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3"></font></u></strong></p>  <p><strong><u><font size="3">Clash!</font></u></strong></p>  <p>It was probably 6 months after this picture was taken that the worst possible thing happened. After just recently installing a new sparco bucket seat, I wanted to test it out on the way home to see how the seat felt. sadly, I forgot that my rear tires were pretty worn, and that there was an elevation change in the corner I was driving on. this put me into a battle head on with a Chevy Silverado..and..we both ended up knocking each other out so to speak. I ended up knocking his tranny loose, blowing out his rear leaf spring, and axel, and shifted the frame a good six inches. as for my car? well…..something like this…</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c" border="0" alt="l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg" width="504" height="404" /></a></p>  <p>also my poor hello kitty license place frame!!! no0o0o0o<img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" /></p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706" border="0" alt="l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg" width="504" height="404" /></a></p>  <p>the hit managed to snap my coilover clean in half…</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1" border="0" alt="l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg" width="504" height="404" /></a></p>  <p>all hope isn’t lost though! my motor was still good to go!</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419" border="0" alt="l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg" width="504" height="404" /></a></p>  <p>the shockwave was actually so bad it went all the way through to my roof<img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" /> luckily, I walked away without a scratch.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Well, That’s about it for the first part. Hopefully this helped you guys learn some more info about where I started, and the first few car’s I’ve owned so far. MY bad for makin you read a huge novel…but I’m bad a writing stuff…and I’m by no means a writer. so yeah. haha If you have any questions or comments feel free to post up^_^ I’ve got the next part of this coming within the next few days probably. more than likely it’ll be whenever I get the time to sit down and type one of these out. lol Hopefully you enjoyed this one though.
