Lookie what I got in the mail today!^_^ props to Ken for suggesting I get these swift springs before doing my corner balancing. So far there's some noticeable differences between the springs that come with my Megan Racing Street coilovers and these Swift springs. They feel about half the weight, and also the coils look slightly smaller, and better spaced apart.

I plan on doing a full write up on these things and how to install them tomorrow.
