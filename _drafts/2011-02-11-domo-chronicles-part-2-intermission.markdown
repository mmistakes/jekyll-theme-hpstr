<p>well, since the first article I wrote did so well I decided to do another one. lol hmm… well let see… I guess I’ll just continue where I left off then.^_^</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/domo_kun.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="domo_kun" border="0" alt="domo_kun" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/domo_kun.jpg" width="504" height="427" /></a></p>  <!--more-->  <p> After crashing the clean red car, I was suuper bummed and had possibly one of the worst months in my life. Which was just full of bad-luck streaks. I had just changed the oil, and did a tune up with new spark plugs and wires before crashing the car. I also had to drive to the biggest nissan meet f the year in my rental car(2009 Chevy mailbu). Then, I nearly lost my debit card just before the event. lol and to top if all off it was a week until my birthday when I had crashed it last march. So…yeah…that month wasn’t very kind to me. lol </p>  <p>Initially I couldn’t decide what car I wanted next, so I just started looking around at all kinds of cars. From rx-7’s to corolla’s. While, I always wanted a corolla, I wasn’t ready for the work that it takes to put in those cars just yet. I still felt like a 240 was the way to go. Then one day my buddy Jamie said that his brother reggie had his 240 just chillin at there house and that they were thinking of selling it. After going down to check it out, I had thought it was okay, but it needed some work.</p>  <p>The day I showed up to buy the car, it was running but just barely. the thing was like driving a smoke show, and for some reason ran suuuper rich. I totally smoke screened out the freeway, while driving up to the ferry in bremerton,wa. I used roughly 1/2 a tank driving only 20-40 miles. lol </p>  <p>Now, here’s the icing on the cake. After waiting in line for the ferry, It was time to start boarding. So, I go to start the car….and…..nothing. the thing would not start. I ended having to get pushed by essentially what was a forklift with a huge tire on the front, into an open parkinglot to fix the issue. After talking to my buddy ricky, he told me to pop the injectors out, and let the car idle till it runs out of gas. that thing probably ran for a good 2 minutes straight with NO injectors plugged in. So, deciding this motor had something up with it, we decided to put Anna under the knife, and stick my motor from the red car in it.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n" border="0" alt="27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p><img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" />poor thing………</p>  <p>*side note: when we had the red car towed up to my buddy’s shop after I crashed it, we decided to have some fun with it. lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="0310001544" border="0" alt="0310001544" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>HELLA FLUSH! <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png" /></p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n" border="0" alt="40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg" width="504" height="377" /></a></p>  <p>we needed something to prop up the backend of this white S13 shell. then we realized, let’s put it ontop of my car! haha sadly, this is how it lived out the rest of it’s days before being towed off to the big racetrack in the sky <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" alt="Sad smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" /></p>  <p>Anyways, back on topic! So, we pulled the POS single cam motor that was in the grey car a.k.a Anna to replace it with my dual cam from the red car!</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577221918_1456937958_1041911_7544522_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="27264_1400577221918_1456937958_1041911_7544522_n" border="0" alt="27264_1400577221918_1456937958_1041911_7544522_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577221918_1456937958_1041911_7544522_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s the motor that just doesn’t like black people apparently. I later sold this to my other friend tim, who has had zero problems with it what so ever… lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n" border="0" alt="27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>doing some cleaning on the engine bay and prepping to stick the motor in.</p>  <p>Once we got the motor in, I as a lot happier. Since the single cam motors are pretty gutless compared to the dual-cam ones. Shortly thereafter I got my bucket seat&#160; and some other parts transferred over. It was then that I realized I needed a new steering wheel to fit in my bucket sit. lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n" border="0" alt="28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>The car had also came with some tein coils, and I gotta say. For a while I was pretty happy just driving another 240 again. But because I was so spoiled with a really clean car, I felt like this one would never be able to live up to the potential like my previous car. I was thinking about fixing all the body damage on the car, but I later found out the whole core support would have to be replaced.</p>  <p>I was just curious one day, and started looking at some 240’s again. I then came across this really clean cherry red one. Once I saw the phone number of who was selling it I immediately realized who it was. Just so happens to be it was the same old guy, that I bought my previous red car from. I still to this day don’t know why I just didn’t get a car from him in the first place. but so far I’m happy with how things have turned out. This is how the car was the first day I brang it home.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n" border="0" alt="28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>the car was a perfect starter for me. the body was straight for the most part, the interior was clean, and the motor ran fine. I realized that the wheels were horrible though ,so I later changed them out.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528740656_1456937958_1244292_1300709_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28471_1480528740656_1456937958_1244292_1300709_n" border="0" alt="28471_1480528740656_1456937958_1244292_1300709_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528740656_1456937958_1244292_1300709_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>So far I’ve been lucky and all of the cars I’ve owned have had really clean interiors.</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528900660_1456937958_1244296_7591484_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28471_1480528900660_1456937958_1244296_7591484_n" border="0" alt="28471_1480528900660_1456937958_1244296_7591484_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528900660_1456937958_1244296_7591484_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>just like the old red car I bought, the old guy gave me a factory brochure for this one as well.</p>              <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480529060664_1456937958_1244300_1748492_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28471_1480529060664_1456937958_1244300_1748492_n" border="0" alt="28471_1480529060664_1456937958_1244300_1748492_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480529060664_1456937958_1244300_1748492_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>managed to change out the horrible,horrible wheels that it came with.lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528980662_1456937958_1244298_6124976_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="28471_1480528980662_1456937958_1244298_6124976_n" border="0" alt="28471_1480528980662_1456937958_1244298_6124976_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528980662_1456937958_1244298_6124976_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>I then started moving stuff over from the grey car, over to this one</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/35865_1480529380672_1456937958_1244304_4021497_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="35865_1480529380672_1456937958_1244304_4021497_n" border="0" alt="35865_1480529380672_1456937958_1244304_4021497_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/35865_1480529380672_1456937958_1244304_4021497_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>my bucket seat, wheel, and a few other knick knacks like squash air freshner, and jdm option sticky pad for the dash that made the interior look pretty nice. lol</p>  <p><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/35865_1480529340671_1456937958_1244303_3138034_n.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="35865_1480529340671_1456937958_1244303_3138034_n" border="0" alt="35865_1480529340671_1456937958_1244303_3138034_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/35865_1480529340671_1456937958_1244303_3138034_n.jpg" width="504" height="379" /></a></p>  <p>I also forgot to mention. I’ve always had a domo on my car. even in the previous maroon and grey cars. So, now I’m kinda superstitious about not having one. haha^_^ I decided to go buy a new one for this car. lol</p>  <p>Since I had two cars, it gave me a chance to just daily drive the grey one, and start building up the red car. Since it was a really good base to start with, I figured I’d start coming up with some ideas on what to do. My friend ricky ended up giving me a few great ideas, and things just started going from there. But, you won’t get to see what that is quite yet. You’ll have to stick around for the next part of this to see what I have in store for the red car. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png" /></p>  <p>Sorry for makin you guys read a novel again…like I said… it’s kind of a loong story. haha lemme know what you all think. Also if you have any questions feel free to post them up in the comments! thanks!^_^</p>
