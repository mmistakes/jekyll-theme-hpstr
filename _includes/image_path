{% comment %}
This file will prepend the image path `{{site.url}}/images/` to any image
that does not have two slashes `//` in the path. That way, an image url that
points to another website won't automatically have this website mistakenly
added to the front of the url.

A string beginning with a single slash will be prepended with {{ site.url }}

This file must NOT have an extra carriage return at the end.

{% endcomment %}{% capture first %}{{ include.image | truncate: 1, '' }}{% endcapture %}{% if include.image contains '//' %}{{ include.image }}{% elsif first == '/' %}{{ site.url }}{{ include.image }}{% else %}{{ site.url }}/images/{{ include.image }}{% endif %}
