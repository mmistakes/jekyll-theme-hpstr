hey everyone,

sorry for being so dead recently. I've just been busy with work, life stuff, and alot of awesome stuff with Yuki which you'll see some posts about starting the new year.

that aside, I just wanted to give a heads up that i'm going back to japan again! This time its for the holidays. I'm trying to finish packing as we speak before flying out later this afternoon. So, Look forward to some more awesome Japan related stuff coming your way over the next couple weeks! Later!
