So, here's my second to last post of my winter japan trip. Just a heads up, once this series is over, you'll be seeing some big changes on the site. :p anyways, on to the next stop which is the Kansai region!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11125" alt="DSC_0118" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

<!--more-->First things first, I grabbed my ticket and headed over to Kakegawa station to take the shinkansen to Osaka station.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2233.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11126" alt="IMG_2233" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2233-e1399235675934.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

From there I metup with my friend Satoko who was nice enough to let me stay at her place while in Kansai for a bit.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2236.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11128" alt="IMG_2236" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2236.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

My first plans while in Osaka was to play some basketball with my friend Koju. However, I completely forgot to bring my basketball shoes with me on the trip..&gt;&lt; While on the hunt for some new shoes, I ran into this wierd spaceship looking thingy. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2248.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11136" alt="IMG_2248" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2248.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Also spotted this white GT-R way in the back, although I was a bit late snapping the picture. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2247.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11135" alt="IMG_2247" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2247.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Finally, after search I found this tiny little shop called <a href="http://www.dopehoop.com/">Dope Hoop</a> near Namba!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2246.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11134" alt="IMG_2246" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2246.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

I ended getting a great deal on These Jordan Melo's. Just let it be known that most regular places don't sell shoes over size 28(US 10) in japan.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11141" alt="IMG_2257" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2257.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></a>

The next day I metup with Koju and got my ball skills(or lackthereof) on! I can't wait to go back and play again.<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2262.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11175" alt="IMG_2262" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2262.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span>Although, even though I was the tallest person there, everyone was disappointed I couldn't dunk. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11142" alt="IMG_2261" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2261.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Staying on the same subject, I saw this sign over at Tennoji Station in Osaka, and was a bit confused at first. I later realized its just the name of some stores. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2252.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11140" alt="IMG_2252" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2252.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

The following day, I headed over to Nara to meet my friend Eriko, who's mom runs a small cafe! The food was awesome and I'm looking forward to going back there to visit.(ignore my massive finger in the picture)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2264.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11145" alt="IMG_2264" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2264.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Another thing I didn't know, is that Eriko's mom(Etsuko) also holds ukulele workshops once in a while there at the cafe. So, I put my rusty playing skills to the test for a bit.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11173" alt="1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n.jpg" width="720" height="960" /></a>

We took a short drive over to Nara park to go checkout the crazy deer they have there.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2266.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11146" alt="IMG_2266" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2266.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Here's some video of us getting attacked by the deer. lol You can buy Senbei(crackers) at the entrance, and feed them to the deer as you go deeper into the park. Just be careful, they eat ANYTHING. I jokingly offered one deer my phone to eat, and he didn't hesitate in trying to chew on it. lol

After being harassed by the deer, I was able to snap some pics before escaping.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2271.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11148" alt="IMG_2271" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2271.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2272.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11149" alt="IMG_2272" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2272.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

After going back to Osaka, I met with my friend Yuna for some Katsudon. she normally lives in Finland, but came back home for the holidays. The last time I saw her was like 3 or 4 years ago back in seattle. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2285.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11174" alt="IMG_2285" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2285.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2286.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11155" alt="IMG_2286" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2286.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

I had nothing planned the following day, so she invited me to come hang out at the mall and join her family for dinner. when I went to go check out the gamecenter there, I was blown away by this kid playing the Taiko Master game.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2299.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11163" alt="IMG_2299" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2299.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Dude was playing with invisible notes!! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11164" alt="IMG_2300" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2300.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Also, Sonic decided to make a guest appearance. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2306.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11165" alt="IMG_2306" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2306.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

We then later went to this place for dinner.(I don't remember the name at all). haha I had an awesome time meeting her family, and everyone was really fun to talk to. One highlight of the night, was when her grandma kept asking to get hooked up with my dad. &gt;&lt;<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2308.jpg"><img alt="IMG_2308" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2308.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a>

The next morning, I set out to do some exploring since I finally had some downtime.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11107" alt="DSC_0001" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0001.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

One thing that can get very confusing, is the multiple exists at trainstations. This happens to be simple since its a small one. But, in some of the bigger ones, you have multiple numbered exits for West, East, South, and North exits.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11108" alt="DSC_0003" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0003.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

I hopped on the train over to Q's mall near Tennoji Station to see what was going on. <a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0004.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0004.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

The weather was great, but I wasn't able to find anything interesting really..<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11110" alt="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0005.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Spotted this cool Subie Forester with some PIA rack lights<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11113" alt="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0010.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

And this classic Toyota Celica<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11112" alt="DSC_0008" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0008.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

I then decided to walk down along the street since I saw there was some park/zoo thing off in the distance to the left.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11114" alt="DSC_0011" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0011.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

It kind of amazes me how japan is able to keep these railways so clean and well maintained. We just have one in seattle, and its ALWAYS dirty. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11116" alt="DSC_0014" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0014.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Making my way....over that way. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11115" alt="DSC_0012" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0012.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Once I got there, this wierd pigeon was marching around like he was in the military. so...I snapped a quick shot. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_00261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11122" alt="DSC_0026" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_00261.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

One thing I do like about japan in general, is how much awesome architecture there is, and how it blends old with new stuff. Like this clock, with an older castle in the background.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11117" alt="DSC_0015" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0015.jpg" width="474" height="715" /></a>

&nbsp;

This zoo/park thingy was wierd. You had to pay to go inside...but it was all fake animals. haha I guess that's one way to keep cost down *shrugs*<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11119" alt="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0021.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

&nbsp;

I snapped some more shots of builders while making my way back.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11120" alt="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0022.jpg" width="474" height="715" /></a>

&nbsp;

Sometimes I got vertigo just looking UP at them. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2240.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11131" alt="IMG_2240" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2240.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

&nbsp;

One of the few times I ate mcdonalds over in japan. The french fries tasted a bit less salty, but other than that...things were pretty much the same for the mcdouble and the quarter pounder. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2313.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11171" alt="IMG_2313" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2313.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

&nbsp;

After dinner, I headed out to get some night shots and enjoy the scenery.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2289.jpg"><img alt="IMG_2289" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2289.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

It wasn't a very clear night, so I had a difficult time shooting stuff up at this lookout area.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0117.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11124" alt="DSC_0117" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0117.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

&nbsp;

I really need to work on my night photography..:\<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11125" alt="DSC_0118" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

&nbsp;

The next day, I headed up to Kyoto to meetup with my friend Yukari and grab some dinner at this little Izakaya place.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11151" alt="IMG_2280" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2280.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

I forget all of what I ate, but this sashimi was bomb!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2282.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11177" alt="IMG_2282" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2282.jpg" width="720" height="960" /></a>

On the way back, I made a quick pitstop to say hi to my friend Akane while she was working her part-time job at this english pub. There was actually alot of foreigners in there, so I guess that's where they all hang out at. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2284.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11178" alt="IMG_2284" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2284.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

Well, that's about it for Kansai! There's a pretty popular and hilarious show called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_no_Gaki_no_Tsukai_ya_Arahende!!">Gaki no Tsukai </a>that has a 6 Hour special every year around near years. I got lucky and was able to watch it live this year! :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2312.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11170" alt="IMG_2312" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2312.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

&nbsp;

The next and last stop will be in Gunma! So, stay tuned!
