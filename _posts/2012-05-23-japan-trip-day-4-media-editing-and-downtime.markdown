Day 4 was pretty uneventfull,and started by waking up, and being super sore from doing the Drift School the day before. I then packed up and took the train back to Tokyo.

After getting back back to Tokyo, I decided to grab some lunch from 7-11, then start sifting though my massive media pile from the past 2 days. haha The chicken sandwich on the right was great! I wish we had it in the US :(

These are all the goodies and stuff I got while in Gunma and Ebisu Circuit. Many thanks to Eichi for giving me some awesome stuff, showing me aroung Gunma, driving all the way up to fukushima, and letting me stay at his place for a few nights! ^_^

Tomorrow I plan to meetup with my friend Ken and have Yakiniku, play some video games, and go hitup the park for some skateboarding and football.
