With the Kansai section of my trip finished, it was time to catch the long train ride back up to tokyo, and then up to gunma! I went there when I came to japan last year, so it was great being able to visit again!

Breakfast for the morning consisted of some various buns from 7/11, Milk Tea, and fruit yogurt!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1330.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10272" alt="IMG_1330" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1330.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

One thing that surprised me when I stopped off again at 711 to grab some snacks for the train was running into these Pepper Salami doritos..0_o I wasn't brave enough to try them though. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1329.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10271" alt="IMG_1329" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1329.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I forgot why I took this picture, but I felt this bear was really interesting.  haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1331.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10273" alt="IMG_1331" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1331.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

Once I got off of the train, I metup with my good friend Eichi from Re-Sanai and went back to his place to drop off all my stuff, and unwind for a few hours. One thing I noticed that's different from last year, is this huge row of solar panels they installed. It's always neat to see rural places use higher technology like this to make things cheaper and better for the environment!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10108" alt="DSC_0001" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00011.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We had some time to kill before meeting up with other people, so once again we headed over to our friend Okada-san's Pudding shop called <a href="http://www.crayon2007.com/" target="_blank">Crayon</a>!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00051.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10104" alt="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00051.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

He makes everythign from pudding, to cookies, to cool drinks to enjoy during the summertime. It's really too bad we don't have one of these here in Seattle. I tried to convince him to open up a branch over here, but with had no luck. ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10106" alt="DSC_0003" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

He even makes things like these awesome tarts!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10105" alt="DSC_0004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I ended up getting the Mocha, Custard, and Chocolate flavored puddings, as well as a milk tea, and vanilla ice cream with caramel ontop. The puddings, while small, are surprisingly filling! &gt;&lt; I was done by the second one, but managed to put it all down. Another thing I noticed, is when you order milk tea in japan, they let you add your own creamer and sweetener!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10103" alt="DSC_0006" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After waiting for him to finish up a meeting, he agreed to take me out for a spin in his rx-7 touge monster sporting around 650hp! Those wanting to see more pictures of this car can check out my post from last year <a href="http://domofactor.com/2012/05/japan-trip-day-2-gunma-adventures/" target="_blank">here</a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10102" alt="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00071.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There's a video down below of the ride-along. However, it was a bit damp out, so Okada-san was being a bit cautious to not really let it open. Next time, hopefully I can ride along during a dry day! ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10100" alt="DSC_0011" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

That's the face of one man in the ZONE, and another one who's VERY tired. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10099" alt="DSC_0013" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The inside of this car is strictly business, as you can see form the racepack cluster, and stripped out interior. lol Another thing that put a huge smile on my face, was hearing the massive HKS T04 turbo spool up. can't wait to get my SR going so I can hear the same sound. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10101" alt="DSC_0009" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After saying goodbye to the delicious pudding shop, Eichi and I headed over to the shop to wait for our friend Asuka so we could go and eat at a local ramen shop that Eichi and his girlfriend Emi know the owners of.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10098" alt="DSC_0018" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Along the way we spotted this clean Toyota Celica!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10275" alt="IMG_1337" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

While waiting, I decided it would be cool to do another small photoshoot. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10096" alt="DSC_0020" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This time around, there are only a couple cars outside. Since last year, Eichi has gotten another job which has taken up a majority of his time. So, now the shop is open for appointment only.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10095" alt="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

But, that still doesn't stop me from enjoying the awesome-ness of this place!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10093" alt="DSC_0023" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its kind of funny there's this tiny shop way out in gunma, but nobody would be expecting...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10091" alt="DSC_0026" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A monster time attack FD lurking behind its walls driven by the one and only Tarzan Yamada himself! Apparently, the only thing wrong with the car, is the fuel pump setup isn't working. The engine itself which is puts out around 500hp I believe, it still in working condition. Eichi said that until somebody fixes it, it probably wont ever see the track again, since he just doesn't have the time for it. I've volunteered to save this car from such a cruel fate if I ever get the chance! haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10079" alt="DSC_0042" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This was a new addition since last time, a super clean FB!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10094" alt="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I'm still amazed at how well japanese people keep care of their cars. This interior literally smelled and looked brand new!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10082" alt="DSC_0039" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The car only had around 100km on the odometer to boot!!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10080" alt="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Inside on the table was this familiar cutaway from last time...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10090" alt="DSC_0028" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

and some stickers, along with the new Vaka-mon(tarzan yama) sticker set. Eichi was nice enough to give me one as a present, but I still haven't figured out where I want to stick it yet. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10089" alt="DSC_0029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Moving into the other garage, was this green FB from last time, still in great condition!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10088" alt="DSC_0031" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

and also still rocking the original carburetor!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10084" alt="DSC_0036" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Moving on was this super clean RX-2 that I belive was there last time as well<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10087" alt="DSC_0032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This one was sporting some aftermarket carbs, which were oriented pretty cool. They should make some super long velocity stacks, and do a cutaway on the hood to make them stick out. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10086" alt="DSC_0033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A close-up of the 12-a motor that both of these cars run.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10085" alt="DSC_0035" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

You gotta have alot of respect for Mazda for being different back in the day, and coming up with something they can really call their own. While I've never actually had the chance to own a rotary, I do have alot of respect for them.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10083" alt="DSC_0038" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381-e1371593396536.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I found out when I arrived in Takasaki on my way to Maebashi, is a ton of these guys called Daruma. Apparently Takasaki is where they originated from. The goal of these little guys, is to paint half of the face, then finish it once you've accomplished whatever goal it is you set out for.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0048" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing that caught my eye this time was this cool Tomika book dedicated to rotaries that Re-Sanai was featured in!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

on the way out of the shop, spotted some Advan tires, and turbo goodies<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10078" alt="DSC_0043" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Shops like Re-Sanai and people like Eichi are one of the reasons I really love japan. I can't wait to come back and help him resurrect that Yellow FD! ;) haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10092" alt="DSC_0024" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After meeting up with Asuka, we headed about 20 minutes down the road to visit this Ramen shop. Of course, I made sure to keep my open for things like this S14 drifter along the way. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10074" alt="DSC_0050" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I finally was able to make it and try this awesome ramen from the shop calld <a href="https://www.facebook.com/menya.gekkou117" target="_blank">Men-ya Gekkou</a>. Which by far, was the best i've ever tasted in my life. I liked it so much, I was actually given a second helping of noodles on the house, even though its not normally offered! ^_^ Pictured below is my standard choice of Miso Chashu.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10073" alt="DSC_0051" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10072" alt="DSC_0052" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

When ordering, most Ramen places, and some other food places use these ticket machines. So, you need to buy the ticket first, then give it to the employee.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10276" alt="IMG_1339" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

It actually had a really cool feel to it, which seemed different from other ramen places I've visited. It was cool to see this huge painting of Seattle native Jimi Henrix!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10071" alt="DSC_0053" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Luckily, when we came it was a bit late on a weekday night, so the rush was pretty much gone.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10070" alt="DSC_0054" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I want to thank Ai and Yuya for completely blowing my mind with some great tasting ramen! It was Asuka's first time as well and she was also really impressed.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10069" alt="DSC_0055" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I'll for sure be coming back here to eat on my next trip to Gunma!!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10068" alt="DSC_0056" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One the way to go meetup with Emi, this super clean Subaru was spotted, and the guy even waved back. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10067" alt="DSC_0057" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Eichii actually had a bunch of work to catch up on for the following day. So, he busted out the laptop to get some work done while we waited for his girlfriend Emi to show up at this shabu-shabu resteraunt.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10065" alt="DSC_0059" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591-e1371594437417.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

&nbsp;

One thing I thought was really interesting, is that they always leave the plastic on the top end of your straw so it doesn't get contaminated! haha I don't really care either way, but still its nice to have I guess.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10278" alt="IMG_1341" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

It was my first time having this, and while I was still full from ramen, it was still really tasty! You basically take the various vegetables, and put it into the hotpot over to the left....<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10064" alt="DSC_0061" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

then you take the mean, and let it simme for maybe 30 seconds in the broth.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10063" alt="DSC_0062" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After that, it was time to head back home. I then realized I had completely forgotten to do my laundy. So, I headed over to a neary laundry mat, and watched the thing go around and around. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10280" alt="IMG_1343" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

The following morning it was time for me to do the final leg of my trip, and head back to tokyo for the next 3 days. It was great visiting everyone up in Gunma, meeting new people and I can't wait to go back there again! So far, out of all the places i've visited, Gunma is my definitly my favorite. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00581.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10066" alt="DSC_0058" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00581.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>
