So finally my last day of the trip arrived, and I really didn't want to leave. Luckily, I had saved some of the most fun for last, and headed back up to Tsukuba Circuit for the day to Cheer on Hideki and his AE86 participate in Idler's Games! ^_^

First off, I'd like to kick myself in the butt, for not verifying some pictures trasnferred over to my laptop before deleting them off the SD card. &gt;&lt; I had borrowed one from Hideki to use while I had my go-pro footage recording so I could still take pictures. But, when I got back home, I realized all of the pictures I had THOUGHT copied over, were all corrupted...T_T

Anyways, the day started off with Derek coming by and picking me up in this SWEET Nissan Largo!Â <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10350" alt="DSC_0231" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10419" alt="IMG_1388" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

It even came with a KA24DE!! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10420" alt="IMG_1389" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After getting some breakfest we setup on the 2hour drive from Tokyo to Tsukuba Circuit.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10351" alt="DSC_0232" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some of you who read my posts from the last trip, probably recognize this building. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10352" alt="DSC_0233" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We also drove by the giant Skytree Tower<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10353" alt="DSC_0234" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While on the road we spotted one of the Eneos fuel trucks<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10354" alt="DSC_0235" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also was one of those tricked out japanese 18 wheelers. lol I forget what they're called though.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10355" alt="DSC_0236" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Just like last time there's plent of small tuning shops with awesome cars scattered outside the track, such as this Audi.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10356" alt="DSC_0238" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After parking and walking towards the track, we spotted Hideki's trailer!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10357" alt="DSC_0239" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its pretty cool since its a double decker, but the best part of it....<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10358" alt="DSC_0240" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

yes, even their trailer truck has bucket seats and a harness! haha if you'll recall there was a little Nissan pickup that I thought was interesting because it had bucket seats in it.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10359" alt="DSC_0241" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also spotted was this awesome official Tsukuba Circuit S15 Pace Car!!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10360" alt="DSC_0243" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once entering the circuit pit area that awesome feeling came over me where I still couldn't quite believe I was here at Tsukuba for Idlers.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10361" alt="DSC_0244" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I also think its cool they provide these small gas stations on the track. I noticed this last year at Fuji speedway, and again here at Tsukuba. It makes it much easier than having to make a run miles away. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0297" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One of Derek's friend's Ben and his wife who run a car importing business in Canada also came along. When we first entered, we immediatly were drawn to the new purple RWB creation.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10362" alt="DSC_0245" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This thing is simple amazing, and you can see its creator Nakai-san catching a quick nap over in the corner.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10364" alt="DSC_0248" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Even Derek agrees that huge double stacked wings make for great way to escape the heat! haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10368" alt="DSC_0253" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its also pretty cool how the turbo is just hanging off the back like that. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10367" alt="DSC_0252" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Moving on, we ventured further down into the pits, and ran into some surprises...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10371" alt="DSC_0256" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Like this little Honda<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10373" alt="DSC_0258" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

a super clean Z<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10375" alt="DSC_0260" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

That was driven by this kid. haha just kidding :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10382" alt="DSC_0269" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

and for the first time, I saw a TVR in person. This thing is...beautiful!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10377" alt="DSC_0262" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The interior was also amazing on this car. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10380" alt="DSC_0266" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh yeah, and we can't forget this massive V8 under the hood<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10381" alt="DSC_0267" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There was also this super rare Austin Martin.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10386" alt="DSC_0274" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Not sure why, but this official Idlers porsche reminds me of a Hot Wheels car. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10388" alt="DSC_0277" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We spotted a section with a bunch of 86's and figured Hideki was among them somewhere.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10390" alt="DSC_0279" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After a few minutes we spotted his car and eventually him.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10391" alt="DSC_0280" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I think its safe to say Ben doesn't fit in these very well. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10392" alt="DSC_0282" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a quick shot of the engine bay. The one thing i've always liked about cars in japan, is their simplicity.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10394" alt="DSC_0284" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I turned my attention to the car infornt of his, and noticed it also had a Garage Miura sticker on it...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10393" alt="DSC_0283" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Turns out his dad(Yasuhiro-san) also enjoy's driving 86's around the track and has been racing 86's and other cars for around 30 years.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10398" alt="DSC_0288" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

His dad's setup was running this new blacktop 4AG swap, so we was a bit unsure of how the car would perform.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10397" alt="DSC_0287" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The car was still running a parial interior, but just by looking at the cluster you can tell its a racecar first and foremost. Also, it doesn't seem like his dog liked me hanging around, so we moved on to check out some other stuff. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10404" alt="DSC_0295" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were also a bunch of these mini-f1 cars that were called Formula Kei<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10401" alt="DSC_0292" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

To my surprise, they were actually running SR engines! 0_o also, anybody spot the Williams replica paintjob in the corner?<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10400" alt="DSC_0291" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I think its safe to say, porsche's dominated the attendance at this event. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10403" alt="DSC_0294" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

I thought it was funny how almost everybody was in the pits, and not in the grandstands. That means, more people actually went to the pits to check out cars, and interact with the drivers.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1390" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After the first Qualifying session where hideki managed to lock up 7th, we headed into the cafeteria to get lunch. <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10422" alt="IMG_1391" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Excuse the horrible photo, but it was actually pretty corded in there, but the AC felt reaaaly good. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10423" alt="IMG_1392" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I ended up eating the some Gyudon and miso soup.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10424" alt="IMG_1393" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

While we were eating, plentyof other classes were still going, and the track was pretty much being used almost all day long!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10418" alt="DSC_0328" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While I was on vacation, I realized I didn't take any pictures of my comapny's mascot Roger the robot. So, I figured this was a good chance to snap a few while I had all my things with me. This is also a good section to mention, I totally missed getting almost all of the action pictures since they were part of the corrupted batch I mentioned earlier...T_T<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0302" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I'm going to have to skip ahead towards the end since I don't have any shots really after this point. Hideki ended up with a GREAT start in the race to pull up to 5th, but tire wear caught up to him, and he fell back to 7th place in the end. He had won this race in the past in 2010 and again in 2012. But, he still had some awesome driving to keep the 2 guys off of him for most of the race, and really pumped me up to go do some driving of my own! I'll include some videos of his Qualifying and Race at the bottom of the post.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10412" alt="DSC_0321" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Hideki also introduced me to one of his Friend's Suzuki-san from the shop <a href="http://2106power.blog21.fc2.com" target="_blank">Orange Planning</a> ended up qualifying 1st, and managed to hold off the other car for almost the entire race to take the win.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10411" alt="DSC_0319" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Sadly, I don't have any pictures of his car..T_T but the setup for his engine was pretty interesting as It used a combination of different toyota engines, such as an AE101 bottom end.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10413" alt="DSC_0323" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had people get up on the podium and pose for pictures and whatnot shortly before. Before the race, Suzuki-san joked that if he won I can just take his place on the podium. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10410" alt="DSC_0309" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another thing I thoguth was pretty neat, is they also get a picture of all drivers who participated in the race.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10414" alt="DSC_0324" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After doing the ceremonies, it was time to go through the pits and cleanup.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10426" alt="IMG_1395" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The best thing about owning hatch backs, is how much stuff you can cram back there. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10427" alt="IMG_1396" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After packing up, I grabbed something cool to drink and to keep me awake. haha This latte I bought was AMAZING. one thing that threw me off is withÂ japanese vending machines, some give you the option for cold or hot drinks.Â I wasn't paying attention and accidentally ordered the hot one which I later gave to somebody. lol d<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10425" alt="IMG_1394" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

As you can tell, I look pretty tired. So, I managed to hitch a ride on the back hatch back to the parking lot area. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10429" alt="IMG_1398" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></a>

The whole time this guy in the truck seemed to have a good laugh at my hanging off the back of this loaded up 86. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10428" alt="IMG_1397" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After a few short minutes we passed through this tunnel underneath turn one. Hopefully, I'll get to see Tsukuba Circuit again, but as a driver instead! ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10407" alt="DSC_0298" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While outside on the parking lot we also spotted this super awesome rally style Evo.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10430" alt="IMG_1399" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Overall, it was hot, but I had a great time visiting Tsukuba again and can't wait to go back!!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10431" alt="IMG_1400" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Derek and Ben ended up leaving part way throughout the day. But, Wataru and Azusa were nice enough to give me a ride all the way to Haneda Airport even though they live here near Tochigi. Its also worth noting Natsuko and her friend who's name I forget also came out to cheer on Hideki. &gt;&lt;<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10432" alt="IMG_1401" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

We loaded up the in DoriNeko Mobile....<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10433" alt="IMG_1402" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

And caused shenanigans the whole way there! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10434" alt="IMG_1403" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></a>

Once we got the the airport, it was only around 7pm, and my flight wasn't until midnight.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10436" alt="IMG_1405" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

They didn't have anything going on that night, so they were hanging out with me in the airport until my flight. Haneda is actually a really nice airport, and its location is smack dab in the middle of tokyo.

I totally forget what this was called, but it was rice with egg and pork...I think. lol its about 3 weeks after as I write this so I can't quite remember. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10439" alt="IMG_1409" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Before heading off to go check in, we made a stop at the Hello Kitty store, and were a bit surprised with some of the things we found...0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10440" alt="IMG_1410" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After checking my bags in, and parting with everyone, my Japan trip was finally coming to a close sadly. The one thing I took away from this trip, is that Japan really is AWESOME. If given the chance, I would LOVE to live here. I can't wait to come back, perhaps i'll come back a bit sooner than waiting an entire year again. lol Hopefully you guys enjoyed these posts! ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1408" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Its worth noting, I had such an itch to do some racing from watching hideki and everyone else race, that as soon as I got off my plane, I dropped my bags off at home, and headed straight for the Go-Kart track! haha
