One more post i've got for you guys tonight is one I just quickly shot in my garage trying to play around with some low-light/color shots. :p I'm by no means a photohrapher, some of these pictures may suck. *shrugs*

Yuki glaring back at the camera from the shadows. :p

pretty cool looking interior shot! ^_^ Eventually I'd like to swap out the Bride seat for an OMP one, possibly get a Nardi wheel, and finally put my stupid drift button on the e-brake. lol

Cookie Tails! ;) (I know, I know, its kouki, but I just had to poke fun at how horribly wrong people say that word)

Playing around with the body shape, and brake lights just being on

I think maybe I should've cropped out the garage door in this one, but still looks cool to me *shrugs*

This one actually is pretty cool I think. I had to press on the brake pedal by hand, and take this at the same time. &gt;_&lt;
