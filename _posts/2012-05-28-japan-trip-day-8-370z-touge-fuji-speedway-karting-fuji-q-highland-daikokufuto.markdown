So, for day 8 my friend Derek from <a href="http://pacificcoastjdm.com/">Pacific Coast Auto Imports</a> was nice enough to rent a 370Z for us to take out to the Mt.Fuji area and do some exploring/touge runs! Those of you looking to import cars from Japan go over to the site, and shoot him an e-mail! ^_^

The day started off with meetup up with Derek and his family over at Yokohama station, then picking up the NIssan 370Z rental car. Sadly, the rental place had disabled the switches to turn off annoying driver aids like TCS(traction control). So, it was a bit hard to have dori action or do doughnuts with it, but still a very fun car overall. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00033.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8067" title="DSC_0003" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00033.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing that really tripped me out while driving is these style traffic lights. This one basically means you can turn left, and go straight, but not turn right. the light will change to yellow, then go back to red, and a green right arrow will appear.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00083.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8070" title="DSC_0008" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00083.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On our way to Fuji we ran into this Chevy shop called <a href="http://marcelo.co.jp">Marcelo</a> in Yokohama.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00103.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8072" title="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00103-e1338254479940.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

This corvette had some aweosome pearl flakes in it!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00193.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8079" title="DSC_0019" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00193.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Derek tryin to act like a baws with some glasses he found under the hood of this camaro. This was on a sunday, so the shop was all closed up. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8080" title="DSC_0020" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Lastly there was an awesome Dodge Challenger R/T sitting there with a nice purple paint job.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8082" title="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As we were heading to the freeway, we spotted this slammed VIP Honda Odyssey.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8091" title="DSC_0037" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After driving about an hour, and completely missing our exit, we decided to make a quick stop in this PA. Luckily we did, because an older guy pulled up in his brand new Subaru BRZ!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8095" title="DSC_0048" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally arrived at Fuji and decided to grab some lunch at this supermarket before hitting the touge. After we came out, there was this clean Celica sitting next to us with Speedline wheels, and some wierd clear gascap thingy. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8061" title="aIMG_0286" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286-e1338255236165.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Lunch for the day consisted of Pizza with corn on it, which actually wasn't too bad!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8105" title="DSC_0059" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After breaking for lunch, we ran into yet another surprise. This tiny little drift shop called Auto Garage Replica.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8110" title="DSC_0064" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

At the time, these guys were working on this S15, and the rx-7 there in the background.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8100" title="DSC_0054" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This NSX Type-R was tucked away in the corner. I wanted it SOOO BAD!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8102" title="DSC_0056" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This tuned kei car seemed a bit out of place here at this drift shop. I Believe it was a Nissan March.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8103" title="DSC_0057" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This March was no joke either, it was a fully gutted racecar. Why? well..because RACECAR of course.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8122" title="DSC_0076" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Time do DO WORK on Ashigara Pass!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8125" title="DSC_0079" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The road start off super narrow. so ontop of adjusting driving RHD and this being a bigger car than what i'm used to, it was a bit difficult to go balls to the wall knowing there's bikers n whatnot around.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8131" title="DSC_0085" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some evidence of late night drift action!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8139" title="DSC_0093" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I managed to take home a piece of tailight that somebody left behind from trying to get a super entry drift, and losing a fight with the gaurdrail. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8142" title="DSC_0096" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

naturally there were pieces of rubber, and chunks lining the outside of the road here. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8145" title="DSC_0100" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The view of Mt. Fuji here was really cool. It was a bit sad, that because of the humidity, you couldn't see everything as clear as it would be back in Washington State.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8170" title="DSC_0129" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once we got to the top, we ran into this guy who was cruising on a little Honda Baja 50cc bike. Uphill he said its a nightmare, but downhill is lots of fun. Turns out this guy is a Prototype Engineer at Nissan. We tried to get him to spill the beans on the S16 Silvia, but all he could say is "maybe" with a wry smile. So, something tells me that there's one coming ;) I Believe his name was Hanataro, but i could be wrong. Its hard to remember names for me for some reason. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8172" title="DSC_0131" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After some Touge we originally, had planned to go to Fuji-Q Highland to check out the Evangelion World exhibit. However, we ran into this awesome kart track called <a href="http://www.apg-kart.com/">APG(Auto Paradise Gotenba</a>) on the way there, and decided to stop and take a quick peek.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8178" title="DSC_0139" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

It looked like we had just came in while they had a qualifying session underway. Most of the kids driving seemed to be from ages 7-12 or so.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8179" title="DSC_0148" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

even though these kids were young, they were hauling around this track.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8191" title="DSC_0183" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

These kids had some really nice lines, and a couple really good passes in the braking zones like pictured above.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8185" title="DSC_0164" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We noticed this stack of rental cars chilling in one of the bays. So, we went down to ask the manager if it was possible to rent them. Turns out it was, but only from 4:30-5:30 that day. It was roughly 3pm when we check the time. We then asked him "how long does it take to get to Fuji-Q Highland?". His response was about 45 minutes. Then, we asked "well, what about fuji speedway?". This answer of 15 minutes we liked a bit more. There was a ton of traffic during the day however, so we weren't quite sure of 15 minutes was accurate.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8197" title="DSC_0201" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The manager (who's name escapes me) was nice enough to draw us a map of a shortcut on how to get to fuji. APG is where we were at, and the circled blip at the top is fuji speedway. oh, and the swastica symbol in japan is actually used to Temples.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8200" title="DSC_0206" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to pull into the entrance to the template for a couple quick photo's. We didn't go all the way inside, but from the super long entrance road, it probably was pretty big.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8203" title="DSC_0213" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://www.fsw.tv/english/">Fuji Speedway!</a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8205" title="DSC_0216" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

According to Derek, you normally have to pay an entrance fee at the gate just to get in. However, this was a Sunday and for some reason, nobody was at the gate. So, we were able to drive right in, and head up to the grandstands without anybody saying anything. lol This is one of the cool things I like when compared to US tracks. Ones here, are just open for anybody that want to use them, even worldwide known ones like Fuji Speedway.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8207" title="DSC_0222" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There a surprise about this Levin a bit later in the post....^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8209" title="DSC_0226" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some guys working on a Ferrari racecar checking tire pressure or temp I assume.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8212" title="DSC_0230" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here there's a NSX making mince-meat out of a nissan kei car,and hunting down what looks to be a Porsche 911.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8230" title="DSC_0333" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

nice rear end shot of that Ferrari. It was moving pretty quick down that front straight compared to other cars. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0348.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8233" title="DSC_0348" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0348.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We left the grandstand to see if we would be able to get into the pit area. along the way back to the car we saw this beetle filled with Mamashiba!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0350.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8235" title="DSC_0350" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0350.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also along the way we found this poor Toyota Supra that apparently met its demise with one of the track walls :(

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0353.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8236" title="DSC_0353" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0353.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Upon entering the pit area with no resistance, we found this super rare Austin Martin 777 getting gas from a wacky Eneos employee. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0398.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8254" title="DSC_0398" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0398.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

a quick overview heading into the main paddock area

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0426.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8262" title="DSC_0426" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0426.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This super sexy Ferrari Enzo was spotted and the guy looked to be packing up to leave already.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0429.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8264" title="DSC_0429" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0429.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I'm not sure what cars these were, but they looked awesome! so if somebody could fill me in somewhere in the comments section, it would be appreciated! ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0433.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8268" title="DSC_0433" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0433.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a cool shot of a Kouki S14, having to get the front dumper, and splitter removed in order to get it onto the truck. Also, here in the corner is that red Levin I mentioned earlier. Let's go over and talk to him!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0437.jpg"><img title="DSC_0437" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0437.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a quick interior shot of the car. It's pretty standard, but still clean at the same time. This car sees double duty as a drift car, and a grip car.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0436.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8271" title="DSC_0436" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0436.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The owner of this little Levin(nicknamed Anna) is Miura-san of Garage Miura from down in Shizuoka. Why is this guy so cool might you ask? It's just an ordinary levin with a standard 4age right? well....

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0454.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8286" title="DSC_0454" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0454.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We asked if it was possible to get a ride along in his car, but he replied saying that the track time for his session is already over. But, he said we can go around on the outskirts of the track and have a bit of fun. I  was already super pumped about being able to ride in it, when he said "do you wanna drive?" I was completely dumbfounded that he would let some random foreigner from Seattle drive his car. After babying it around a few corners, he said "you can revv it up to 8k rpms". so, on one of the straights, I Really got on it, and man this car sounded amazing! It had dual 40mm carbs on it, so the response was great!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8294" title="DSC_0464" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Me trying to explain that 86's in the US are expensive as hell, and Miura-san responding with "oh, I only paid $300 for mine stock." I wish deals were like that in the US. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8291" title="DSC_0461" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A quick picture with Miura-san again before heading back out to the Karting track! Those interesting in seeing more about his car you can view his Minkara page in the link below!

Derek's all fired up!

I'm....stil trying to figure out what's going on...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0473.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8301" title="DSC_0473" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0473.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh right! helmet on, okay now I got it. ^_^

My time was a :59.792 and the record for that day was 58.366. So, I think if I had a bit more experience with this track I might be able to shave another second off. One thing that was fun, is these were the fastest karts i've driven yet, so flying into the first corner was a ton of fun. lol Also, I believe the manager's name is written there to the left. so, if anyone could translate that kanji for me it'd be appreciated! ^_^ It's worth noting some of those custom karts from earler were getting times in the 44 second range. lol

quick photo before we leave of Derek, the manager, and myself. He was really nice, and when I asked him about my lap times he said, they were okay. haha personally I thought they were pretty damn good for being in a rental, and never driven the course before. I actually ended up lapping Derek, although he spun on the corner as I was coming up to challenge him. maybe next time we'll be able to have more of a battle! haha ;)

Next stop for the day was Fuji-Q Highland! there was one problem though, apparently the park seemed to be closed. The entrance was wide open though, so we walked in to take a look and try to find Evangelion World.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8310" title="DSC_0485" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Along the way we found this cool Hamtaro boat ride. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8315" title="DSC_0492" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally made it to our destination! but, as we feared it was already closed! :( my buddy mike was really looking forward to pics from this, so I felt kinda bad. But, I made it up to him by getting some awesome stuff the following day at the Toyota History Garage. So, look for that a bit later. ;)

After some walking around to check out other closed down attractions, we headed back to the exit. Except there was one problem....we somehow got locked in! 0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0519.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8340" title="DSC_0519" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0519.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

So, we had to resort to using our old school playground skills to escape. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0520.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8341" title="DSC_0520" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0520.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

here you can see our lone 370Z chillin in the parking lot. We were pretty much done in the Fuji area, and proceeded to go find some food, before going back to the Yokohama area for one last stop.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8064" title="aIMG_0292" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

We decided to hitup this mcdonalds by the freeway and surprisingly, after about 8 days in japan, this was my first time finally going there. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8063" title="aIMG_0290" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I ended up ordering Large size for everything, since it seems mcdonalds in Japan is basically a step down from what we have in the US. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8344" title="DSC_0523" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

When we were leaving to go back to Yokohama this Subaru Rally car was chillin outside. Its funny how often you run into awesome cars over here compared to in the US.

Our final stop for the day was the legendary Daikokufuto PA just across the Rainbow Bay Bridge. While I didn't get any pics of the bridge, Derek got some video footage of my driving over it, so I'll upload that and link to it here in a bit. Just look for the video link at the bottom of the post!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8360" title="DSC_0555" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As as were walking around this super loud Wangan tunes 86 showed up. You can tell he's serious by all the crazy functional aero stuff he has done to the car. especially the splitters on the top of the door. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8364" title="DSC_0561" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here you can see more crazy aero with his front canards, and splitter. All these parts are one-off, and he showed us some video on his phone of him driving the C1 Loop. All I can say, is this dude has balls of steel! Driving this car at 200km/h+ would scare the crap out of me. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8374" title="DSC_0576" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The next car we ran into was this super clean Hakousuka Skyline! We went and talked to the owner, and asked him to open the hood to see what was inside, since it didn't sound quite right.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8390" title="DSC_0596" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

To our surprise it had a L28 from the Datsun/Nissan 240z, except this specific one had been over bored to make it an L30 which 3 Litres of awesome-ness!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8387" title="DSC_0590" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here we were talking to the owner of this nice looking Toyota Altezza who says he's making about 450hp on 1.4 bar of boost which is about 20psi or so.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8386" title="DSC_0589" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a better close-up of the Beams 3SGTE motor running a Trust turbo, but I forget which specific model. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8389" title="DSC_0593" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I never noticed how cool the tach on these altezzas looked. I'm not sure of this one, is specific only to japan, but I really liked how the overall speed was in the center, with smaller gauges inside, and rpm off to the side there.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8393" title="DSC_0601" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Since it was already a bit late, and all the trains stopped running at midnight, we had to book it out of there, to make my trains in Yokohama. I wanna give a huge thanks to Derek for showing me around all over the place, and renting the 370Z for the day!

I've got video from this day, so I'll sort through it and get it uploaded a it later. so sit tight for now on that. :p
