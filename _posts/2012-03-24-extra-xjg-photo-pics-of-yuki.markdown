My buddy Darrick over at <a href="http://xjgphoto.com/">XJG Photo</a> sent me a few extra pics he took of Yuki when he was up here in Seattle last year. So, I figured I'd share the wealth!^_^

EDIT: I just realized how how high my front looks without a lip. lol I really need to put mine on soon...T_T
