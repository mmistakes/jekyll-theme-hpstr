Google is so big, that they have their own compiler and language solely for the purpose of intergrating their different services together, like Gmail, Youtube and stuff. Its not a new language, its just JS, with a lot of Google API. It uses more of API than JS, hence the name Google Script. It works like a charm and is a true lifesaver. If you ever have the plans of doing something across different Google Apps such as Gmail, Sheets, contacts or something, just take a look at Google Script. It would definetely will have something to offer.
