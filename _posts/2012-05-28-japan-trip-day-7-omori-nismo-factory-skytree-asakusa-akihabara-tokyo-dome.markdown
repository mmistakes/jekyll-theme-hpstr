day 7 of the trip was probably the most tiring since it involved walking around literally the entire day! more stuff after the jump.

Matsumoto-san was kind enough to take me around Tokyo to check out some stuff for the day since it was a Saturday and he had the day off.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00072.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7487" title="DSC_0007" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00072.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I met him outside me hotel and we headed over to Omori to go check out the Nismo Factory. We thought it opened at 11am, and had some time to kill so he showed me a few cool places since he lives in this area. First of which is the Isuzu building, which had a flea market/swap meet going on outside.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00102.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7490" title="DSC_0010" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00102.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This place was HUUUGE!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00112.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7491" title="DSC_0011" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00112.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Afterwards, we went to this huuge grocery store area called Ito Yokado.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00123.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7492" title="DSC_0012" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00123.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Outside I spotted a few cool looking bikes. This Suzuki was one of them.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00143.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7494" title="DSC_0014" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00143.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This old school honda was probably my favorite bike i've seen thus far.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00202.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7499" title="DSC_0020" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00202.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Inside there was some awesome looking food, and some weird stuff like this Fish head. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7504" title="DSC_0026" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Along the way I saw this cool Lexus Celsior

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00292.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7505" title="DSC_0029" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00292.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

First stop of the day was the Nismo Factory Shop in Omori

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00312.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7507" title="DSC_0031" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00312.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The first thing I noticed when entering was this SuperGT 350Z chilling off in the corner.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00323.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7508" title="DSC_0032" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00323.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After getting distracted, they have little lounge area with some awards on the back wall, and a crank, some rods and pistons encased there in plexiglass.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00451.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7521" title="DSC_0045" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00451.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The wing on this car was HUUGE!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00442.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7520" title="DSC_0044" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00442.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here you can see a better shot of just how much wider they made the car as well

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00473.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7523" title="DSC_0047" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00473.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

The cockpit of this car had soo many switches and buttons I would get hella confused trying to drive this and focus on everything else. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00612.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7534" title="DSC_0061" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00612.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Naturally, a car of this caliber had a full Carbon underpanel for downforce purposes

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00601.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7533" title="DSC_0060" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00601.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I thought was really cool is the way the center nut on these wheels is designed.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00592.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7532" title="DSC_0059" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00592.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Trying to get creative with my photos. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00542.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7530" title="DSC_0054" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00542.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They also had this cool timeline of achievements along the wall next tothe 350Z

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00532.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7529" title="DSC_0053" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00532.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a quick shot of when the Omori factory first opened!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00371.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7513" title="DSC_0037" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00371.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A quick glimpse into the store-front of the shop.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00382.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7514" title="DSC_0038" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00382.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Yeah, you know just some titanium exhaust, ohlins coilovers, and $2,000 Big brake kits all sitting under a hella expensive Snap-on Toolbox. No big deal.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00712.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7541" title="DSC_0071" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00712.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The welds on this exhaust were really cool looking

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00781.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7548" title="DSC_0078" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00781.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Over to the left there was some Track cars being worked on, some racing DVD's and....

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00771.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7547" title="DSC_0077" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00771.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

These custom Nismo build RB26DETT's...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00791.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7549" title="DSC_0079" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00791.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also, this VQ37 which I know someone who would want it very badly in their S-chassis ;)

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7515" title="DSC_0039" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00391.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

a quick shot of some R35's and 370z's being worked on

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00413.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7517" title="DSC_0041" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00413.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Last here's a picture of some posters, and goodies you can buy here in the corner.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00892.jpg"><img title="DSC_0089" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00892.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next it was over to Ueno to the Flea masket area called Ameyoko(アメ横） to grab some lunch.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00931.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7663" title="DSC_0093" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00931.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The place we went to was a sushi place, but I forget the name. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00941.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7664" title="DSC_0094" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00941.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Outside there were some strays waiting for food too. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0271.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7471" title="aIMG_0271" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0271.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Inside of the place was pretty small, but smelled really good.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0270.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7470" title="aIMG_0270" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0270.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Sushi for lunch, which all came to around $10 bucks, and left me pretty full for the most part. The far left one was actually Sea Urchin, and tasted really good! The stuff on the far right is egg FYI.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7670" title="DSC_0102" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01021.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This clean NSX was spotted on our way going to the Skytree.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01112.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7675" title="DSC_0111" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01112.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The giant golden thingy is a flame and apparently used to stand straight up, but cops thought it looked too much like poo, so they asked the owners of the building to turn it on its side.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01271.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7684" title="DSC_0127" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01271.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once we got to the sky tree area they had this cool little Studio Ghibli shop.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01281.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7685" title="DSC_0128" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01281.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Skytree! it's about 2,080 feet tall.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01381.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7694" title="DSC_0138" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01381.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I also felt the need to take a picture of this guys' awesome photographers pose while trying to take a picture of the skytree.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0146.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7700" title="DSC_0146" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0146.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

These water bottles are pretty cool. they're recyclable, and are able to shrink down by crumpling it.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0159.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7705" title="DSC_0159" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0159.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next stop after the skytree was asakusa. This temple apparently was build around 650ad

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01541.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7703" title="DSC_0154" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01541.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh yeah, newsflash, there's a crap ton of people in tokyo!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0180.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7722" title="DSC_0180" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0180.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next stop after Asakusa was Akihabara. I'll be going there again later in the week, so more pictures will come then as well. This place has a Cafe and gift shop for an all girl pop group called AKB48.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01811.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7723" title="DSC_0181" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01811.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next to the ABK48 cafe/shop was the Gundam Cafe!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7726" title="DSC_0185" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01851.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This rx-8 was chillin outside, and had a nice sounding exhaust note.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01902.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7730" title="DSC_0190" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01902.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Outside there was this mini-statue that said "please don't touch", but these guys thought it'd be funny to mess with the gundam to make him give everyone the finger. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0193.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7733" title="DSC_0193" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0193.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

here's a quick shot of the inside. As well as some lady stuffing her face. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01971.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7736" title="DSC_0197" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01971.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had this really cool feature going the whole time on the tv there.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0206.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7742" title="DSC_0206" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0206.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next stop in Akihabara was the UDX parking lot to search for some itasha!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0213.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7748" title="DSC_0213" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0213.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

At first I was a bit discouraged, since there were no itasha and the first parking level, but there was this nicely tuned rx-7.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02411.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7772" title="DSC_0241" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02411.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Finally we found some itsha! This one is a Nissan S15 and was running stock boost, with a Trust turbo. I forget the specific model, but it was still a bottom mount though. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02431.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7773" title="DSC_0243" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02431.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I forget this guys' name. But, after talking with him about his s15, and showing him my S13 I realized something. In the US, if you take pics of somebody's car, and try to go talk to them, Half the time, the owner won't be very friendly, and start mean mugging you. However, in japan, people are very nice and don't mind talking about stuff.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7780" title="DSC_0251" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Ran into another Nissan Itasha. This one is a Kouki S14, but the owner was nowhere to be found.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7788" title="DSC_0261" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Up on the surface, This Toyota Chaser was spotted!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0265.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7790" title="DSC_0265" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0265.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Of course what akihabara trip would be complete without meido! ^_^ I'll be going back here again to find a tsundere maid cafe, so I'll have more pics in a few days. For now, check the gallery for others.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0273.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7795" title="DSC_0273" alt="" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0273.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way back to the station, I ran into another rx-8.

After Akiba, Matsumoto-san took me to this place that had Tsukemen Ramen. This is just like normal ramen, except the noodles are seperate. So, you don't run into the problem of soggy noodles towards the end! ^_^ I got the extra noodle size and it consisted of 1lb of ramen goodness! haha

Last stop for the day was the Tokyo Dome, which is home to the Yomiuri Giants baseball team located in Tokyo.

Day 8 I ended up taking a trek with my buddy Derek out to the Mt.Fuji area, and also managed to check out Daikokufuto on the way back into tokyo. So, look forward to that sometime tomorrow morning hopefully.^_^ haha
