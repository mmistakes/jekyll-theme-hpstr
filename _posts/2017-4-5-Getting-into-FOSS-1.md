Our FOSS club started flourishing and is gaining more momentum than expected, and the support we're getting for this is unbelievable. Our getting into FOSS was a success, out of 120 Computer Science First years, almost 80 participated in that. Which is a big win. It can be found [here](https://github.com/FossMEC/welcome).
And our welcome to git tutorial was a grand success, considering over 44 people were succesful in submitting a PR. Which is a pretty awesome thing, and a big step for getting into FOSS. It can be found [here](https://github.com/FossMEC/practice-sess). Feel free to adopt the tasks and modifying for your own use. 

May the FOSS be with you.
