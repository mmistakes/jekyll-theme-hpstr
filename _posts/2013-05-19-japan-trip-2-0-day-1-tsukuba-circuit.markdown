Hey everyone,

So, I recently decided to take another trip to Japan for around 2 weeks! I've got a bit of catchup to do since its Day 2 as I'm typing this, but hopefully I can continue to stay ontop of these. Enjoy!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9357" alt="DSC_0226" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

So, to start off from the very beginning, my day didn't start very well leaving seattle. I ended up running a bit late to the airport, and just barely missed the check-in time. My flight was originally at 12:30, then a 3 hour layover in LA before heading to Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Luckily, there was anoher fight to LA around 2pm I could take, and managed to get switched over to that one, and have my $25 fee waived. So, props to the awesome Alaska Airlines staff for getting me sorted out!

After arriving into Tokyo around 11, it took me roughly an hour to go through customs, immigration, get my bags, and sort through the money exchange. By the time that all was finished and I went to catch the train, I literally missed the last one out of haneda by about 1 minute due to the trains stopping around midnight here.(yeah, its really stupid I know...) This meant that I had two options.

A) Take the Monorail to hamamatsucho and get stuck there

B) Take a Taxi to my friend's place directly.

I opted for B, but man was it expensive as hell...&gt;&lt; Luckily I finally got to ride on he Legendary C1 route through tokyo, and saw a few cool cars like the new 86 in the blurry picture below! The taxi ride from Haneda to Musashinoshi costed me around $150..

I was pretty wiped from the plane, so I I wanted to just unpack my bags, then crash. But, nooooo, we were having none of that due to this little surprise I found in my bag. Apparently, the airport people love tossing bags around, and stupid me forgot to make sure the jar of cheese dip was properly coushined. The tip popped off, and the whole thing exploded everyhere. Luckily, all of the food I had could just be cleaned off, and it was still fine. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9381" alt="IMG_1164" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164-e1369031289959.jpg" width="620" height="826" />
</a>

Here's just a quick shot of the room I'm staying in. The room itself it pretty cool since it has the traditional Tatami mats and futon which are both pretty soft and comfortable.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0009" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The next morning my buddy Ken and his wife Tomi decided to take me out to Sizzler. Which was a bit funny considering i've never even been to any of the ones in the US. lol I failed and forgot to get pictures of the food, but they basically had regular breakfast stuff, along with curry,miso soup, and other more japanese style breakfast foods. all of it was pretty good and was buffet style for about $10 I think.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9247" alt="DSC_0008" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

I remember talking to my friend Hideki about a Gymkhana event going on up at Tsukuba that same day, but I didn't know any of the details. I decided to give him a call to see what was going on, and see if it was even worth making the 3 hour trip over to Tsukuba Circuit knowing it was around 11 am at the time.

Luckily he said they were going to be running until 4-5pm, and if I bring my helmet I can do some driving. I instantly grabbed me stuff and hopped on the train with Ken and Tomi who decided to tag along. On the way to the station, I noticed there was a driving school nearby. I like how they actually setup courses to let people practice first, instead of just throwing them into live traffic like they do in the US.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9250" alt="DSC_0014" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I notifced this seemingly abondoned/run down house as well along the way. I didn't notice it at the time, but now that i've looked at the picture its pretty funny since the katakana there reads "kuriinhaitsu" or "Clean Heights". Which...from the looks of it...its definitely not. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9253" alt="DSC_0018" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>
When we got on the train there was a film crew taking video of some group of comedians doing some talk show/vlog thing...it was pretty funny since they kept following us during all of our train transfers. Luckily, I tried to do my best obama impression just incase it gets caught on video! :p
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9255" alt="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

One thing I do really like is how they have vending machines for drinks EVERYWHERE. if there's a zombie apocalypse, you're definitely not going to die from lack of fluids. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9260" alt="DSC_0029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

WERE COMING FOR YOU TSUKUBA!!!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9262" alt="DSC_0035" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Getting on our last transfer on the way to the circuit....but....where's the rest of the train....0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9261" alt="DSC_0034" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Finally, we arrive at Tsukuba!!! It was pretty surreal to actually be here. One thing I noticed right away, is this tunnel that goes underneath Corner #2 to the pits, used to also have a sign that said "Get to the Win!" in engrish. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9385" alt="IMG_1168" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168-e1369033711662.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I didn't enter the main section of the circut since I was on a time crunch and needed to meet Hideki over on the gymkhana course. Right away, I noticed some lone Porsche sitting off in the distance and went to take a quick look.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9267" alt="DSC_0045" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Looks like my insincts were correct, and I managed to see my first RWB(Rauh-Welt Begriff) Porsche in person. I have to say it was pretty amazing, and its no wonder Sakai-san has the following that he does nor only in Japan, but recently worldwide!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9268" alt="DSC_0046" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

I managed to snap a few pictures from the main grandstands area while running around.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9279" alt="DSC_0077" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

One interesting car I ran into straight away was this Formula Kei car. It's basically similar to a formula 3 car, but just a bit smaller with less power. It looked pretty impressive out there compared to all the other cars.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9289" alt="DSC_0098" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Shortly after wandering through the pits I ran into Hideki and his friend Wataru who was currently taking a few runs in the AE86 shop car from <a href="http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/" target="_blank">4-Foot Garage Miura</a>.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9293" alt="DSC_0102" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

I soon found out that Wataru also does drifting and owns a S13 Silvia. A little while later we hit it off once I told him about my s13 and started showing him my build pics. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9302" alt="DSC_0134" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Speaking of Silvia's I also met his wife Azusa who was driving a Midnight Purple S14 with an N/A SR. She also has a 180 that is used for drifting that is also Midnight Purple. When I told her we didn't have that color on Silvia's/180's in the US the look on her face was priceless. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9343" alt="DSC_0204" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Hideki also introduced me to his girlfriend Natsuko who drove this black FD3S. I managed to grab some video footage of one of her runs down towards the bottom of this post!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9359" alt="DSC_0230" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9308" alt="DSC_0143" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After watching people drive to get a feel for the course, I ran around trying to source some long sleeves and pants to I could do a few runs in the AE86. I found some....but...they didn't quite fit the best. :p and yes, that is a man wearing pink bunny ears, they probably give him +5hp or something. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9347" alt="DSC_0208" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Next up, it was my turn to give it a go. Even just sitting in the car, everything felt super wierd and shifted to the right. I've driven a couple RHD cars already from last year when I came to japan. But, it was only for a couple days, so it still takes some getting used to.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9312" alt="DSC_0151" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

I didn't realize it at the time, but I only had 2 runs, and not 3. I took it pretty easy on the first one just to get the course memorized. Then was going to go all out on my second one.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9324" alt="DSC_0174" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I pulled in after the first run to go over some different lines and how to best attack the course. Now, I kind of get how F1 driver's feel during Hotlaps for qualifying. Granted, they've already had some practice sessions to hash out how the cars feels and whatnot. but, it was still pretty intersting just showing up, and being given 2 runs and adapting to a new car along with RHD to top it off.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9329" alt="DSC_0183" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg" width="620" height="936" />
</a>

Waiting in the grid for go-time!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9292" alt="DSC_0101" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Green flag lifts, and i'm off. Its always awesome how when you're waiting for the signal, you're mind blanks, and all you can hear is the sound of your heart pounding away from the adrenaline.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9337" alt="DSC_0196" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Sadly, I didn't manage to put in a very clean run. Having to look down when finding the shifter, along with not being used to shift with my left hand really threw off my mechanics. lol Hopefully, I'll be able to practice at it a bit more in the future! I was surprised with how responsive this 86 was, the engine sounded great, and there was a bit of bog in the carbs at some of the lower rpm's. but, having a stock KA back at home, I'm not used to rapping the crap out of a car, especially one that's not mine. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9338" alt="DSC_0198" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Afterwards I went to talk with Azusa and Wataru about various s13/nissan stuff. It's always cool when you can go half-way across the world and find people who are interested in the same things as you.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9350" alt="DSC_0212" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Azusa and Natsuko ended up getting 2nd and 3rd in the woman's class!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9362" alt="DSC_0234" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Hideki also places 7th in his class, but since he was busy packing up his things during the ending ceremonies, Wataru proudly stood-in for him. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9371" alt="DSC_0254" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As usual, there's a few people that really like to enjoy themselves, and make other people have a few laughs. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9373" alt="DSC_0261" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Somehow the mask also made its way into the Formula Kei car as well. I think the need to mound that there permanently to strike fear into whichever car is ahead of it. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9366" alt="DSC_0242" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I had a great time, and snapped a few photoshoot worthy pics of Hideki and Natsuko. They then surprised me and said we'd get to do some pace laps around the main course. to which, I nearly ran and jumped around like a schoolgirl when I found this out. Video of the pace laps is down below!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9390" alt="IMG_1173" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173-e1369037264144.jpg" width="620" height="826" />
</a>

I had a great time with everyone and can't wait to see them all again at the Idler's event on 6/2!! It was great meeting everyone, and also thanks to Masaya(guy in orange) for an awesome event!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1175" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

It was a pretty long day, and I was started to feel the jetlag kick in. One thing that's interesting to note, is just how far out into the countryside some of these circuits are. This is the little train station called Sodo that we got off/on at, and from here you need to take a taxi to the circuit for about 10minutes.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9377" alt="DSC_0269" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Dinner before going to bed was some Katsu Curry and rice! Overall this trip it starting off great, and it will be hard to top this level of awesome-ness for day #2. lol
