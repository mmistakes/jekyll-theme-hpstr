Instead of going for GSoC 2017, I've decided to develop myself and by retrospecting, I found it to be much more better than GSoC. My skills have been considerably increased, I feel that I have much more control over django and finding out solutions to messy problems. Other than that I have tried a hand at CSS and Bootstrap and have considerable grip over it. I've also tried a hand at machine learning and its pretty darn exciting. In other good news, a FOSS club initiative has been started at college and some of us was given the responsibilty of building a static website for it, which is something to look forward to. We also got a request to build a dynamic website for nummadekochi, which is a big accomplishment and in which we are using django as backend and completely using the admin feature of django. Altogether this looks like a wonderful year to look forward to.
