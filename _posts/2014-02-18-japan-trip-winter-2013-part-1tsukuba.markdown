hey guys,

finally, after a few months of slacking and putting this off here's my the beginning to my 3rd Japan Trip! Enjoy!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0066.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10575" alt="DSC_0066" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0066.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<!--more-->So, previous cases when I went to Japan its always during the spring around May. This time, I wanted to experience what early winter was like, so I went over the New Years and X-Mas Holidays! This also gave me an extra week to spend. So, I was able to go for 3 weeks instead of the normal 2. :p

Anywho, I set out from Seattle and landed at Haneda around 11:30pm. My friend Wataru and his wife Azusa were picking me up from some station over near Ibaraki. Which meant I had to transfer about 2 different times, all while hauling all my crap (suitcase, backpack, duffle bag, and a smaller suitcase). Luckily, I barely made my last transfer and arrived at the station on-time. The problem however, is I didn't yet have my rental sim card, and no wi-fi. So, I had no way to really get in touch with him. Also, he failed to tell me that this station unlike most country-side ones, has multiple exits. So, after the station started closing and I wandered around trying to get wi-fi for like an hour before finally just using my roaming with Verizon.

Once he arrived, he told me his place was too small so we were gonna try and find a hotel for me, but it was too late at night, and check-in as long overdue for most places. Sooo, both him and his wife looked at each other and said "I guess all that's left is a Love Hotel". If you don't know what that is, do some google'ing. :p Anyways, once we got to the place we were like crap...who is gonna be the one to go with me to see if there was a room available. As funny as it was, his wife made Wataru go with me. So, basically 2 dudes walked into a love hotel, saw it was way too expensive for just one night, and left. haha

In the end, I ended up sleeping in their car at the Convenience Store next to their place. :p Not the most comfortable, but it was fine for just one night. haha

The following day, we got me checked into pretty cool older-style hotel with tatami floormats. Wataru had work and Asuza had some stuff to do, so I had a free day to wander until later that afternoon.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10533" alt="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0005.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10531" alt="DSC_0004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0004.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>I started off by walking around, to see what I can find, and surprisingly, this is what I run into...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10532" alt="DSC_0006" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0006.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>There was this super clean 86 sitting there, on what looked some tiny shop. I went to talk to one of the guys about it, and they said it was the owners, and had been sitting for quite some time.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10534" alt="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0007.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>Some other awesome cars were sitting there too like this Evo.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10536" alt="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0010.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

As I started to walk into the main street this horrible looking FD went wizzing by :p
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10537" alt="DSC_0014" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0014.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I decided to venture off onto a side street for about 30 minutes, and take some scenery shots.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0017.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10538" alt="DSC_0017" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0017.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10539" alt="DSC_0015" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0015.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10540" alt="DSC_0018" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0018.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10541" alt="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0021.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10542" alt="DSC_0020" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0020.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

by this time, it was later in the afternoon and I didn't eat lunch yet, so I stopped in at this Ramen place. The owner was actually super surprised that A) somebody non-japanese walked in and B) I spoke pretty fluent japanese. haha I ended up getting some free ice cream which was really nice of him!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10545" alt="DSC_0025" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0025.jpg" width="620" height="410" />

On the way back to my hotel I spotted some cool cars hiding around :p
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0026.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10544" alt="DSC_0026" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0026.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0027.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10546" alt="DSC_0027" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0027.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0028.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10547" alt="DSC_0028" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0028.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

So, fast forward to the next day and friend Hideki from Garage Miura, and Suzuki-san from Orange Planning were going to be driving in the 86 Festival over at Tsukuba Circuit. Since Wataru is a friend of his, and also drives 86's, the plan was to head over there with Azusa who also drives an S14 Silvia. Before they came to get me, I made sure to get my fill of morning sentai tv shows! haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10653" alt="IMG_2126" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10654" alt="IMG_2128" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After Wataru came to get me from the Hotel, we headed back to his place to get Azusa. I was able to meet his brother and mom, and also snap some pics of their rides, and an evil kitty. lol

We then made our way over to Tsukuba Circuit which was about 15 minutes away. At the entrance, we ran into once of Azusa's friend's s13.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10558" alt="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0041.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As we headed into the circuit, there was also all the normal assortment of crazy 86's. It is interesting seeing some of the US style and parts coming over to japan now. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0047.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10564" alt="DSC_0047" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0047.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

[gallery columns="4" ids="10565,10566,10567,10562,10561,10559,10560,10622,10621,10563"]

Once inside, we started searching for Hideki amogst the masses of 86's!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0058.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10570" alt="DSC_0058" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0058.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

for some reason, the blue pearl-ish of this one really stood out to me!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0060.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10571" alt="DSC_0060" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0060.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally tracked him down after a few minutes, just as they were about to head out for Qualifying.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0062.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10573" alt="DSC_0062" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0062.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>We also found Suzuki-san next to him in he grid in the orange/black coupe.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0158.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10599" alt="DSC_0158" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0158.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0065.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10576" alt="DSC_0065" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0065.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

while they were running Qualifying, I headed off to check out some other cars. Lots of famous 86's were there such as CBY, Tec-Arts, Tsuchiya's personal car, and the TRD N2 racecar. The TRD car specifically was really clean and had some crazy looking headers.

[gallery columns="4" ids="10577,10575,10578,10568,10607,10606,10597,10598,10600,10605,10609,10608,10580,10579,10604,10601,10602"]

After qualifying, it was time to snap shot shots of the main race. Hideki was able to win his class, but I wasn't able to get go-pro footage. So, luckily Hideki took some for me with his own camera. :p<a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0092.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10586" alt="DSC_0092" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0092.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Afterwards there was a pretty cool drift demo, and it was nice to see drifting back at Tsukuba after D1 left here years ago!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0195.jpg">
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10615" alt="DSC_0195" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0195.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Let me just say that these things are loud, and wayyy faster that I thought they would be in person! 0_o<a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2134.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10657" alt="IMG_2134" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2134.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After that we decided to head out, to go into the mountains for some sightseeing since I was leaving for tokyo later that night. So, see you again Tsukuba Circuit!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0234.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10619" alt="DSC_0234" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0234.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>We first headed up what was called the "Purple Line" of Mt.Tsukuba. This is the place in Initial D where God Hand and God Foot race at actually. haha There were already a few people up there enjoying the view as well.[gallery columns="4" ids="10623,10624,10625,10626,10628,10627"]
On the way back down, we stopped off at the Tsukubajinja shrine, which was actually pretty amazing. I would've hated to go there back in the day when there were no roads. haha
[gallery columns="4" ids="10623,10624,10625,10626,10628,10627,10643,10646,10645,10642,10641,10640,10639,10638,10637,10636,10635,10634,10633,10632,10631,10630,10629"]
Also, got a pretty nice shot of Wataru trying to look like a badass and Azusa just looking plain cold. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10644" alt="DSC_0261" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>After the shrine, the last stop for the day was UP Garage! Even though this was my 3rd time in japan, I had never been there surprisingly! haha I was so surprised by how cheap the parts were! Hopefully we'll get one again over in the US, or something similar.[gallery columns="4" ids="10674,10672,10671,10670,10669,10667,10668,10666,10665,10664,10663,10662,10647,10648,10649"]
Well, that's pretty much it for my Tsukuba stop of the trip! Hopefully you didn't get worn out. Since i'm writing this more than 2 months after the fact, i'm sure there's some stuff i'm missing. But, stay tuned for the Tokyo part of my series to be uploaded next within a week or so! As always, a full gallery of all the pictures are down below!
