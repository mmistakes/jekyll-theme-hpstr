Mentors are the most purest of souls, I have been helped in all levels by people on the other side of the globe who patiently cleared all my doubts and helped me develop my skills. They are the real heroes and I have the uttermost respect for the people who willingly lends us their precious skills to help us overcome our trivial hurdles. I sure hope that in the future I can too help newcomers of programmers succeed by helping and mentoring them. I wind up this post by thanking all the people who helped me increase my current knowledge and giving me directions.
