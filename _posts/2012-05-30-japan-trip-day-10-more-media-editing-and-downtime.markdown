Day 10 was another down day for me. Most of it involved catching up on blog posts, seeing darrick off to Narita Airport, and grabbing some food with my friend Yoshi again.

Breakfast for the day consisted of more awesome french toast, a cream bun, some starberry yogurt, and more milk tea. :p

after chilling at my hotel for a while, and catching up on some blogging, we took the JR Yamanote Line over to Shinagawa station, so he could catch the Narita Express train, that goes directly to the airport.

After a long day of catching up with blogging, I decided to try this vietnamese place by my hotel. Their Pho was actually pretty good, and I really liked whatever noodles they used.

It had this pretty cool view from the window of the main street too.

Yoshi replied to my message I sent him about getting a bit late, and I had already eaten dinner. But, I met up with him anyways, and he had this huge burger, while I had something a bit smaller.

I ended up getting the apple pie, which was HELLA SMALL. It was good, but jeez..I was pretty dissappointed. one thing I wont miss about japan, is the small portion sizes. while, sometimes its nice if you're not hungry, i'd rather have extra to be able to take home for lunch or something. lol

That's about it for day 10. I've noticed every couple of days I need to have one of these downtime days just to recharge, and catch up on everything. lol
