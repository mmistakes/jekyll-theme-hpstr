So for day 12 I made my way back from Gunma to the crowded place that is Tokyo!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1346.jpg">

Day 12 was pretty uneventful. I woke up in the morning, and Eichi had to take off early for work, so Emi was nice enough to drive me down to the train station. Once I transferred at Takasaki, and got on the Bullet train, I had a bit of a surprise.....yeah, that's a double-decker bullet train! The downside, is there isn't as much room to store your things. So, I was forced to leave all my luggage in the seat spaces next to me. Luckily for me, nobody ended up getting assigned those seats the whole time. :p

After finally making it back to Tokyo, I headed towards Meguro to go to my hotel. This really clean Evo was spotted along the way. lol

I finally arrived at my Hotel, but as a little bit early for checkin. So, I decided to hang out in the lounge, and get some photo editing done. I'm staying at the same hotel I stayed at in last year called Hotel Mid in Meguro. After waiting for about 30-45 minutes my room was finally available, and I was completely dead from lugging my stuff from Tokyo -&gt; Shizuoka -&gt; Osaka -&gt; Gunma and now back to tokyo again. So, I took a nap before later meeting up with some friends of mine.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1346.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10231" alt="IMG_1346" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1346.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After taking a power nap for about 5 hours, I woke up feeling MUCH better. However, when I headed out to meetup with Brian and Matsumoto-san for dinner, this is what I had to deal with...T_T Welcome to rush our on the Yamanote line. &gt;&lt; <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1360.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10234" alt="IMG_1360" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1360.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I didn't get any pictures with them, but I did manage to grab some of the food. The place we went to was an Izakaya that specialized in pork. So, we got some salad, skrewers, pot stickers, and bbq pork!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1348.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10233" alt="IMG_1348" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1348.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

That's really about it. It was a pretty un-eventful day for me, but it was some well needed rest knowing what was to come!
