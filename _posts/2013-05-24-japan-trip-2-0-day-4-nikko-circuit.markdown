Hi everyone,

Recently Alexi Smith over at <a href="http://noriyaro.com" target="_blank">Nori Yaro</a> told me there was a Wind's Auto drift day going on at Nikko Circuit. So, I decided to make the 2.5hr trip up there for the first time to check it out! It's worth noting before I start, that halfway throughout the even, I realized my camera settings were totally jacked up. &gt;&lt; so, some of the pictures came out wayy too light. haha

At first I really didn't feel like going just because I had previously went to the same area in Tochigi for Tsukuba just a few days earlier. But, then I remembered how much crap I would've gotten had I not gone. :p So, I grabbed a few things at the convenience store before heading out in the morning. On thing I noticed is that the Pringles here in japan taste totally different! they're less salty. My friend Shunji in seattle is ALWAYS buying pringles, so I guess thats why. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9709" alt="IMG_1207" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207-e1369444714318.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I started off with taking the shinkansen from Tokyo Station. Turns out I had about 30minutes to kill before my train, so I did a bit of exploring outside the station.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9463" alt="DSC_0030" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There was this cool courtyard area with small waterfalls that I ran into.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9472" alt="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I didn't want to wander too far, so I just posted up on this street corner to see if I could snap any cool things that drove by. :p Sadly, there was nothing that exciting, and after a while I made my way back to the train station.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9476" alt="DSC_0045" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I always forget to take pictures of are these JR ticket machines. They're really easy to use in both japanese and english. You can also recharge your SUICA card here, which is basically like a rechargable card. I finally decided to get one this time around, and its much easier than dealing with a bunch of tickets.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9483" alt="DSC_0056" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

If I haven't already mentioned it....there's a TON of people here in tokyo. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9484" alt="DSC_0057" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Inside the station, they have another special gate for the shinkansen, with people to help you out so you don't end up on the wrong train or something. lol

&nbsp;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9486" alt="DSC_0059" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After being on the train for a couple hours, I finally arrived at Utsunomiya, and was suprised with how many taxi's were lined up outside. Luckily, I happened to pick the perfect one!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9490" alt="DSC_0065" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Along the way, I had a great conversation with Yama-san about various things about the US and Japan. He was even nice enough to cut my fare off early, and I only paid part of what I was really supposed to! ^_^ Between the shinkansen and the taxi fare I was supposed to pay, you're looking at around $100 just to get to Nikko Circuit. Sadly, Yama-san doesn't use facebook, or mail or anything, but hopefully he enjoys reading this! Also, he recently had a baby 3 months ago, so congratulations to him!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9492" alt="DSC_0067" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

When I first walked into the area, I was a bit shocked to believe I was actually AT Nikko. The one thing I also enjoyed, is unlike events in the US. It's FREE to come and hangout in the pits, and watch the event. You only pay if you're going to be driving. Also, the prices on food/dinks weren't hiked up, and were actually super cheap.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9493" alt="DSC_0068" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This super clean Nismo styled 180 caught my attention

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9494" alt="DSC_0069" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also, here's one of the Wind's Auto owned R32's

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9497" alt="DSC_0072" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

a quick shot looking back on the part of the pit area

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9498" alt="DSC_0073" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There certainly were some unusual drift cars out there today, like this SW20. He also had some pretty amusing stickers which you can catch out farther down below!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00771.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9499" alt="DSC_0077" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00771.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here this EVO was getting in some AWD drifting action. It was really wierd watching this car drift since there was hardly any countersteer, even though he had the angle. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0087.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9501" alt="DSC_0087" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0087.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also, this D1 machines from Thailand was tearing it up all day long!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01461.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9519" alt="DSC_0146" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01461.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Whoever was driving this chaser also drove like his life depended on it. Some of the "mantries" these guys take going into this first corner is nuts!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9521" alt="DSC_0156" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01561.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I also spotted this Missle Chaser from the shop Tokonatsu Factory!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02491.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9529" alt="DSC_0249" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02491.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I also really loved the kit on this type-x S13 that looks like it was also participating in Tsuchiya's new series The Drift Muscle

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0252.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9532" alt="DSC_0252" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0252.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also, IÂ unexpectedly spotted Daigo Saito just chillin along the pit wall. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02541.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9534" alt="DSC_0254" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02541.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

It's kind of hard to tell in this picture, but the paint on this S15 was super epic with a ton of pearl in it. lol

&nbsp;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0255.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9535" alt="DSC_0255" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0255.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

More awesome angle from this D1 machine was was making well over 1000HP with a built up 2JZ motor.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02631.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9541" alt="DSC_0263" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02631.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Since there was a short break in the middle of the day, I decided to take some scenery pics with no cars on the track.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0270.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9543" alt="DSC_0270" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0270.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0271.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9544" alt="DSC_0271" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0271.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0272.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9545" alt="DSC_0272" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0272.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Shortly after arriving I actually ran into Andy and Emily Grey from Powervehicles! Andy and Team Orange Driver Naoto Suenaga are the ones who gave me pointers when I attended the Team Orange Drift School last year! For this interested in that post, it can be found <a href="http://domofactor.com/2012/05/japan-trip-day-3team-orange-drift-school-ebisu-circuit/" target="_blank">here</a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0277.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9550" alt="DSC_0277" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0277.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Sadly, Andy's white chaser ran into a powersteering issue earlier in the day, so he had to retire. Luckily, Emilys blue one was still up and running strong. So, I was able to get some ride along footage with her at the bottom of this post!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0351" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0349" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0791" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing that I noticed on alot of the cars, especially S-chassis, was the very simple mods. Brakes were pretty much stock, with upgraded pads. However, the one thing I did notice, is people actually spent money on quality parts like JIC, DG5, Tomei, ProjectMu, ect.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9552" alt="DSC_0280" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This s14 took me back to the early 2000's for some reason. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9560" alt="DSC_0303" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

These 86's sounded super awesome flying by as well. It's funny when you stop and think that these only have 1.6L compared to the 2.xL of other motors like RB's, JZ's, ad SR's out on the track.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9566" alt="DSC_0321" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

quick shot back at the entrance area

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9576" alt="DSC_0350" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This pretty clean Bilstein 86 was also doing some laps. Although it seemed like he wasn't going very hard on it. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9585" alt="DSC_0371" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Just because it's a new car, that doesn't stop some people though apparently! 0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9586" alt="DSC_0372" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While I was on my way to go watfch some more action from the other side of the track, some body came pulling up with their bumper dragging along....

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9592" alt="DSC_0393" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh hey, look! It's Daigo Saito just trearing up Chaser Missle's as usual. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0395.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9593" alt="DSC_0395" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0395.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Shortly after, it looked like somebody spilled oil on the track. So, all of the drivers went out to help cleanup the mess. This is the one big difference I notice even on Drift Tengoku videos. In the US, we had set corner workers that do this, and the drivers end up just relaxing. But, its kind of nice to see most of the drivers all pitching in to do their part in fixing up the track.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9595" alt="DSC_0397" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They also had this mini street sweeper thing come in to spread out some of the powder, which is used to suck up some of the oil spilled on the track.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9597" alt="DSC_0401" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Afterwards, it seemed like the track turned into a rally stage! 0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9598" alt="DSC_0402" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Even though they could barely see anything, people were charging flat out into the first corner!! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9600" alt="DSC_0409" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some people like this guy were even getting some nice weight transfer going on before the flick to get it sideways.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9604" alt="DSC_0423" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Shortly after, these guys started getting some pretty good tandem battles going lap after lap

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9614" alt="DSC_0465" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I noticed this SW20/MR2 pulled into the pits, so I went to take a picture of its awesome Pedo Bear sticker. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9615" alt="DSC_0478" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They also started getting some good drift trains going on with daigo leading the pack.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9620" alt="DSC_0486" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Except someting looked a tad off....but I couldn't quite figure out what it was... :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9625" alt="DSC_0505" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Shortly after, the MR2 also joined in on the fun

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9629" alt="DSC_0522" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I didn't catch this miata running much, but it seemed really simple and well done.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9630" alt="DSC_0527" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here Emily and Andy go out for another sesstion. It was really interesting riding in her car. It feels soo different compared to drifting my s13. Due to the amount of weight, and wheelbase, and how you can see the suspensio is setup with a really slow rebound in the rear, it had a really nice squat to it when going through the corner. This also gave it a ton of front grip as well it felt like. I can see why alot of D1 setups have been switching to using something similar like this now!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9634" alt="DSC_0537" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another quick shot from the front of this Drift Muscle 180!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9642" alt="DSC_0567" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Emily using some front brake action on corner entry!

More of the usual, This Toyota Altezza just eating pavement for lunch breakfast and dinner! &gt;&lt;

This red 180, was killing it on entires all day long, and even got a couple nice reverse entries in as well. I meant to go ask him what setup he was using for knuckles, but I totally forgot. lol

Here's a couple nicer panned out shot of Emily doing her thing. I was pretty surprised when she said this was only her 6th time actually driving here.

This red Silvia was also super clean as well..hopefully he never crashes it. haha

Finally got an action shot of the nismo inspired 180 from earlier!

I forgot who was driving this Toyota Supra, but it sounded AMAZING.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0786.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9689" alt="DSC_0786" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0786.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were a number of guys from the shop Red-K as well sporting their signature red overalls, and this sweet looking R34.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0789.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9692" alt="DSC_0789" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0789.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I figured it would be a cool to get shot of my helmet from pit wall. :p

Daigo and the Drift Muscle 180 were really going at it towards the end there, and I also managed to capture Robbie Nishida in a picture. haha I managed to talk with him for a bit, and he's a really cool guy. I'll look forward to meeting up with him again when him and his Achilles team come to Seattle for Formula Drift!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1216.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9712" alt="IMG_1216" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1216.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After about 6 hours of what seemed like non-stop driving, people finally started packing up to head home. Notice the super legid trailer in the back that's carrying the Thailand D1 Altezza and Daigo Saito's missle.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0794.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9696" alt="DSC_0794" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0794.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I thought was hilarious was this s13, Â which was originaly white, but had been painted black. It got some reverse colored tire battle scars from his fight earlier with Daigo. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0797.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9698" alt="DSC_0797" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0797.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

It was great meeting Andy, Emily, and the rest of some of the guys from <a href="http://powervehicles.com" target="_blank">Powervehicles.com</a>, and hopefully I can come back up to ebisu to visit sometime in the future!

PS- throughout the entire day I somehow managed to keep my shirt clean, then right at the end as we were cleaning up the pits, I picked up a box of milk tea, that managed to squirt my shirt as I went to throw it away...*sigh*

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0799.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9700" alt="DSC_0799" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0799.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Everybody started packing up to head home, so it was time for me to call Yama-san since I needed to wait about 30 minutes for him to show up from the station.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0800.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9701" alt="DSC_0800" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0800.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Yama-san did me a huge favor, and cut me the same discount fare I got on the way there as well! ^_^

Along the way back to the station I saw this super clean Honda NSX

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0803.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9704" alt="DSC_0803" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0803.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As I was heading into this station there was this local band playing one of their CD's that sounded pretty awesome. Their name was Cure Rubbish.

Overall it was a long and tiring day, but I'm really glad I spend the money and went out there! It's taken me about a day to sift through all my photo's and write out this blog post though. heh

Here's some video footage and a full gallery below!
