Today was pretty laid back, and just involved hanging out with my friend ken at his place for most of the day.

Woke up around 7am to nice weather once again. One thing that's kind of annoying is i've only been able to sleep like 6-8 hours here. I guess it could be due to the humidity n stuff, but generally at night its alot more enjoyable than during the day IMO.

A quick shot of the street below, since I don't think I've gotten one yet.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0254.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7415" title="aIMG_0254" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0254.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Breakfast consisted of more of the awesome Kiriin Milk Tea, French Toast, a Sweet Bun, Peach Yogurt, and some fruit. That French toast was BOMB, and I'm for sure going back tomorrow to get more. haha

The yogurt even had a cool little straw, along with small slices peaches in it. ^_^

While I was waiting for my friend Ken at Kawasaki Station, I spotted this awesome old school car on a flatbed. It was lowered n everything, But, sadly I wasn't able to get my phone out in time to get a closer shot. :(

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7418" title="aIMG_0257" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0257.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Awesome view ontop of the bridge while heading back to his place

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7419" title="DSC_0002" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00021.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Once arriving, I met his wife Sutomi who was very nice and later had a present for us all to try. Shortly after, we busted out the food and began cooking. It's worth noting that Ken's friend Charles brought some SUPER GOOD marinated chicken pictured above with the blue lid. I thought I got a picture of it, but I guess I was too busy eating it. haha

Everybody throwing stuff on the grill, and waiting, which was the worst part of it knowing how good it tasted. lol This type we had was Kalbi which is a specific type of cut from the cow, since its beef and all. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7422" title="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00052.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Just a closer shot of stuff on the grill. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7423" title="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0007.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Before heading out, Sutomi had made us some custom Carmel/Chocolate bread. It was really good. I think so far, one of the biggest highlights of my trip has been the food. haha

Afterwards, we went to throw the football around, and skate at the nearby park for a while.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00352.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7430" title="DSC_0035" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00352.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

It started to get dark, so we decided to head back to the station, and head home. But, the city background looked really cool at dusk.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00472.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7432" title="DSC_0047" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00472.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I guess I have photographer skills sometimes.. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00412.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7431" title="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00412.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One cool thing about where ken lives is that the river below literally seperates living in Kawasaki area vs. Tokyo Metropolis area. Originally he had to pick between a place on either side of the river, but decided on the tokyo side due to some extra benefits it provided.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00492.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7434" title="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00492.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's the sign saying you're entering into Kawasaki.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00481.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7433" title="DSC_0048" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00481.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I kept having to struggle to take quick pictures as we were heading back to the station. This one, is a Honda Civic Type-R passing by.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00552.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7435" title="DSC_0055" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00552.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This one was really hard to get, but I wanted to snap a pic for my friend Mike. I didn't notice it at first, and by the time I had my camera out it was almost too late. But, yeah, its a Toyota Celica that was lowered and had HID's,exhaust, decent sized wheels, and some low profile type kit.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00571.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7436" title="DSC_0057" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00571.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Super clean subie that passed by us. Again, another case of my camera being in my bag, and me having to be a kung-fu master to pull it out in time, and time a picture. I'm gonna have to work on my shutter speed n stuff though. They keep coming out slightly blurry &gt;_&lt;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00692.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7438" title="DSC_0069" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00692.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After getting off at my station and walking back to my hotel I head this guy coming from a mile away! 2jz twin turbo Toyota Supra(JZ80). It sounded so sexy...*drools*

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00651.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7437" title="DSC_0065" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00651.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh, and speaking of sexy. This Ferrari <del>599</del> California(Thanks to Teru-san for the correction) was just chilling across the street from my hotel.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00731.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7439" title="DSC_0073" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00731.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

went across the street to get a better look. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00742.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7440" title="DSC_0074" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00742.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Is it just me, or do those headlights look awfully similar to a 370Z. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00751.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7441" title="DSC_0075" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00751.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Finally, going back across the bridge it looks like some traffic was starting to build up on the other side of the street. In this pic there's a pretty cool looking Alfa-Romeo(center in white) along with an Nissan(infiniti) VIP car(slightly above to the right in white), but I'm not sure of the model. lol

Tomorrow, I don't have much planned. I'll probably hang out at the hotel, work on more footage, watch some anime, and then go meet some old co-workers for dinner.
