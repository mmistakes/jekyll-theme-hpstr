Day 1 of my japan trip is under wraps! Check out the jump below for all the goodies! ^_^

<strong>*Note:</strong> 56k dial-up users BEWARE! There's alot of pics. haha

Overall the trip started fine, got to the airport in Seattle with plenty of time to spare. It was funny though that in both Seattle, and LAX, TSA people couldn't figure out what the hell my helmet+camera gear bag was. lol LAX was especially funny since my camera badgcombined with the camera mount in the next pouch almost looked like a gun in the scanner. &gt;_&lt; haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7098" title="IMG_0198" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198-e1337511635164.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After possibly the worst and most grueling flight EVAR in my life(16 total hours), I arrived to jdm land at last! overall the fact that I was in tokyo didn't quite hit me until a bit later since at the time above it was 5:30am and the airport was pretty dead. Sadly, I had to sit around and wait for that Softbank Place to open at 0630 so I could get my japanese sim card + phone number.

It's worth noting that I ran into Super GT300 Driver Mitsuhiro Kinoshita(Also driver of the WTAC Hankook FD3S). When I asked him if he was Kinoshita-san from Rev Speed and the Hankook FD3S he just replied with "Sorry, no English." so...yeah that was a little disheartening. Since either he was a DEAD look alike, or it had to be him. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7099" title="IMG_0199" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199-e1337511883189.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After picking up my sim card, and exchanging my cash money into Yen(stupid exchange rates..T_T) it was time to figure out how to hell I was going to get to my hotel.  I knew roughly that I had to get to Hamamatsu-cho, and then hop on the JR Yamanote line to get to Meguro which is where my hotel is at.After talking to this lady at the information booth, she said I needed to take the Monorail to get to me to Hamamatsu-cho.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7100" title="IMG_0200" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200-e1337512016681.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Luckily almost all of the signs had english,hiragana, and kanji written on them. So, I at least had a 2/3 chance of being able to read it and figure out where I needed to go. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7102" title="IMG_0205" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205-e1337512133588.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

By this point, I managed to succefully take my first public method of transport into the heart of tokyo. The monorail was pretty dead since it was super early on a sunday morning. But, I was curious when I switched over to the JR Yamanote Line how busy and difficult it would be. Turns out, transferring and using the JR railway overall is a breeze! The ticketing system confused the hell out of me at first, but after the first couple times it made sense.(I totally forgot to get a picture of the ticket machine, so I'll do that tomorrow :p). Anyways, as you can see.....it was pretty dead early in the morning. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7103" title="IMG_0206" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206-e1337512574579.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I managed to brave the worst of my fears so far, and got off at the correct stop. Then, I sort of had to judge where certain streets where based off what I remembered looking at from google maps. My phone has data disabled(cuz its hella expensive), so I didn't have any maps to tell me exactly where the hotel was. Here's an super clean Subaru WRX(GC8) that I saw on the way to the hotel. There was also a super sexy white Ferrari F40 that went flying by, but I couldn't pull out my phone in time!! &gt;_&lt;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0207.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7104" title="IMG_0207" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0207-e1337512755296.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I'm staying at the Hotel Mid in Meguro from a recommendation from ken whos been there many times. ^_^ One thing that was kind of annoying is when I walked in, they said check-in time was 3pm. It was 8am at the time, and I had just flown for 16 hours. So, needless to say I was pretty annoyed. They grabbed a few of my bags to be put on hold, and I set off to do some exploring to kill time.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0208.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7105" title="IMG_0208" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0208.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

A wider view from outside the hotel. This is the main road coming from the train station.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0209.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7106" title="IMG_0209" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0209.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Another shot of the same road going away from the train station. The left side there is lined with some awesome places to eat from the looks of it. So, it'll be fun to go try some. More notably there's a 7-11, Chinese restaurant, and English Pub. So, those ones I'll for sure go to in the coming days. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0210.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7107" title="IMG_0210" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0210-e1337513107345.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Here's something I didn't expect to see here. lol LHD Dodge Magnum w/ some DUB's.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7108" title="IMG_0211" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0211.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I felt a few blisters starting to develop from walking, and was getting tired of the humidity and mild heat(80). It's weird because the humidity here feels different. According to google, the percentage is about the same between here and seattle. but, here it just feels....heavier or something..idk hard to explain really. lol

Anyways, I grabbed a drink from the vending machine outside(80Yen), went back to the hotel lounge, and popped in my Hot Version DVD to kill the 2 more hours I had left.(I forgot to get a picture of the vending machine too, so I'll do that tomorrow.)

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0212.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7109" title="IMG_0212" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0212.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Random side note, this hotel only had one person that spoke conversational english when I showed up earlier. Luckily, I understand japanese better than speaking it because that one person who knew english took off while I was waiting for check in time. So, the girl came around the corner at noon letting me know my room was ready, and needed to go over a few things with me. Apparently, like the trains, everything gets shutdown at midnight here. So, she was telling me that to get into the elevator area I needed to also use my key card if its between 12-6. Overall the staff here are super helpfull, and she even complimented me on my Dragon Ball Z t-shirt. ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0213.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7110" title="IMG_0213" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0213.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

finally.....A BED!!!!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0214.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7111" title="IMG_0214" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0214-e1337513853132.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

The bathroom is pretty cool. It was a recessed floor. So, if you spill water all over the place, it just goes to the drain there under the sink. another thing I liked is they provided bodywash+shampoo in the dispencer thingys. I forgot mine at home, so this was awesome. lol Also, that toilet scared the bejesus out of me. It was one of those built in bidet/butt washer things along with a seat warmer. All of these seemed pretty creepy, and I luckily figured out how to disable them all. lol I like my toilets how I like my revenge. COLD!

I finally managed to get all my crap sorted out luggage wise, and hop online to send out my "I'm still alive emails". Shortly after that one of my previous co-workers who was now living in tokyo gave me a call saying he had church in shibuya(2 stops away from me) from 1-4pm and wanted to meetup for dinner. My eyes were pretty bloodshot from not getting ANY sleep on the flight over here, so I told him to give me a call once his church stuff got out. This enabled me to at least get a few hours of naptime in, before heading out again.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7112" title="IMG_0216" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

One thing I still wasn't sure about fully, was buying train tickets. For my monorail I just chose the monorail+JR Yamanote line button for 500Yen. This time, however there was no button for which specific stop I wanted to go to. There were only faires along with some other misc options. Not realizing there's a chart right effing above my head showing what fares to use to get to a specific station, I just picked 540Yen, and embarked to shibuya. I later found out, that getting to shibuya only requires 150yen...so yeah. lesson learned. lol

Anyways, I was supposed to meet my friend Yoshi at the Hachiko statue outside of Shibuya station which is a really popular meetup spot. Little did I know, is that its on the east exit of the station. Being my normal stupid self, I exited on the west side and wandered around for a while before finally giving him a quick call.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7113" title="IMG_0217" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217-e1337514586460.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

We were going to get sushi, but the place he normally ate at was closed due to repairs. So, we went to this awesome Yakiniku place called Toraji located in the Palco shopping centre.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7115" title="IMG_0220" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Yoshi in all his glory. I like the fact they gave us those aprons to prevent spilling stuff on our shirts. Also, like a few japanese places in Seattle, it looks like no matter where you go, you get something to clean your hands with before the meal. I think its really cool, and wish more places over stateside did the same.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7116" title="IMG_0221" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221-e1337514836746.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Here on the menu they explain all the different cuts of meat, and where they come from. We ended up getting the Toraji Assortment to the right there along with some Salad that was actually really good. It had was really good and had some light tasting type of dressing on it similar to what you get a teriyaki places.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7117" title="IMG_0222" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

OM NOM NOM NOM. The meat was seriously amazing. It was super soft, and falls apart in your mouth.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7119" title="IMG_0224" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224-e1337515129926.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Next up was a short walk down the street over to another shopping centre(forgot the name) for some desert. It had tons of stuff in the lower levels like phones+accessories(yes a whole floor dedicated to that),appliances, TVs, and video games. At the top we came a place called Nishimura Fruits Parlour.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7118" title="IMG_0223" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

My inner Gintoki was not dissappointed, and this Strawberry+Bannana parfait was really good. As you can see, I started tearing through it, then realized I needed to take a picture. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7120" title="IMG_0225" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Heading back to the train station, I saw this epic MIB3 banner. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7121" title="IMG_0226" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I remembered I forgot to grab a picture of my station, so I did so on the way home from dinner. The ticket machines I talked about are to the left there. You tend to get a bit stressed out if you've never used them before, because people are waiting in line behind you. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7122" title="IMG_0227" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Horrible shot of the main street outside of the Meguro station that leads down to the hotel

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7123" title="IMG_0229" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

My last mission for the night was figuring out how the hell to get this A/C thing working &gt;_&lt; all the buttons were in kanji. So some guess work, and a quick google search helped me get the thing running properly.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7127" title="IMG_0232" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Anyways, that's about it for my first day here.I'll leave you with a view from my hotel at night before hitting the sack in a few minutes. Plans for tomorrow are to head out to Gunma in the morning to go tour around with my friend Eichi and also check out his Rotary tuning shop Complete Garage Re-Sanai. So, hopefully I can get there without taking the wrong train to somewhere :p
