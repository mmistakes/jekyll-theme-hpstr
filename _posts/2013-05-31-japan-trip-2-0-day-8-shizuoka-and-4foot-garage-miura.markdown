So, some of you may have noticed i'm a bit behind, but keeping up to date with these recently has been kind of difficult. haha

Anywho, my first round in tokyo was up, and it was time to take the Shinkansen down to Shizuoka and visit my friend Hideki at his garage <a href="http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/" target="_blank">4Foot Garage Miura</a> down in Shizuoka!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00712.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9850" alt="DSC_0071" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00712.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

My morning started out pretty good, and Ken and Tomi gave me some snacks as a present for the Shinkansen even though I said they didn't have to! ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1254.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9878" alt="IMG_1254" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1254.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Then it was off to the Shinkansen from Tokyo station to Kakegawa station near Shizuoka! <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9881" alt="IMG_1257" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1257.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After a couple hours, I arrived and was waiting at this little station when shortly I started to hear a throaty 4AG echo'ing off the buildings. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9884" alt="IMG_1261" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1261.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

We made a quick stop at a Rest Area to grab some souvenirs  Shizuoka is famous for green tea, so hideki bought me some green tea mochi.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1264.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9887" alt="IMG_1264" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1264.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Then it was off to visit the garage, which was about 30 minutes away.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1267.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9889" alt="IMG_1267" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1267.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I could see this nastly weather off in the distance and was hoping it wouldn't spoil my afternoon. <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1266.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9888" alt="IMG_1266" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1266.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

He doesn't quite have the signature Takumi pose, but I guess that's close enough. ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1268.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9890" alt="IMG_1268" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1268.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Initially I was kind of surprised to see a bunch of other cars like Mini's and some kei cars gathered outside. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9847" alt="DSC_0068" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00681.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I didn't realize is the shop itself it owned by his dad. But, Hideki helps run the place along with his sister Yukako, who was nice enough to give me some sweets as a present, but could be there to meet me. Also, I forget what the name of this truck was, but it had some pretty sweet bucket seats and looked like it would be fun to try out as a track car!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9845" alt="DSC_0066" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00661.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were a couple of these cuppachino's spotted as well. It's kind of a shame they don't sell these in the US, as I've heard they're a ton of fun to drive. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00702.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9849" alt="DSC_0070" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00702.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Hideki also had another one of his future projects sitting in the background next to his current daily driver, and track car. I'll get specs on his current track car and post those up later for this interested. ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9848" alt="DSC_0069" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00691.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Not gonna lie, I started hyper ventalating a bit as I entered the garage, since I knew there would be lots of cool things to find! Also, note the sketchy wooden board entrance.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0075.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9851" alt="DSC_0075" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0075.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

I was a bit blown away with all the awesome stuff I started to find as I walked into the shop. I noticed alot of japanese shops are really small, and alaways filled with stuff, but it kind of adds to the character I think of places like this.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9852" alt="DSC_0076" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00761.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This cool Recaro seat was turned into an office chair. I think its from one of the older evo's if I'm not mistaken.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0082.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9856" alt="DSC_0082" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0082.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A quick lookback at the entrance, and huge colletion of magazines, and misc collectables he has!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00891.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9861" alt="DSC_0089" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00891.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On closer inpsection I spotted some of these pictures. I really liked the one in the middle, which looks like the girl is usuing some recently worked tires as a hand warmer! haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0085.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9859" alt="DSC_0085" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0085.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some other rare manga related collcetions from manga like Initial D, Wangan Midnight, Shakotan Boogie, and so on.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0088.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9860" alt="DSC_0088" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0088.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Hideki actually has been participating in alot of grip events the last few years, and managed to place 1st in his class at Idlers back in 2010. I'll be heading up to Tsukuba Circuit on 6/2 to cheer him on, and watch him compete again in this years Idler's Games!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9858" alt="DSC_0084" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00841.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Some fresh seats and racing suits were off in one corner.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00911.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0091" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00911.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Off in another corner a ton of nice deep dished old school wheels are stacked, with some used and fresh rubber.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0080.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9854" alt="DSC_0080" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0080.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

These SSR Longchamps really caught my eye, and unfortunately, weren't for sale. :p haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0095.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9866" alt="DSC_0095" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0095.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This rack filled with different after market wheels, hubs, and quickreleases was pretty cool as well.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0096.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9867" alt="DSC_0096" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0096.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

It's really too bad they don't sell wako's products in the US..:\ If you slide to the left there near the fenders hanging on the wall, you'll be greated with another garage, and some surprises.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00942.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9865" alt="DSC_0094" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00942.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

More 86's!  The lights didn't work at the time, so we just went through the place in the dark with a flashlight and my camera. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9870" alt="DSC_0100" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01002.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Most of these 8's were already tuned, and selling for around 5-7k. Compare those prices to the crap we have to pay for in the US, and you'll get why I wanted to just import one so badly. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01072.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9875" alt="DSC_0107" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01072.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

All of these were either customer cars, or cars that they were tuning to sell.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9872" alt="DSC_0102" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01022.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

You can see that there's not a whole ton of space to work with, but this place definitly had alot of character I think.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9874" alt="DSC_0104" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01041.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here is the red levin that's in the Idler's photo above, and currently has no motor. Hideki pulled it, rebuild it, and put it into his new chassis. At some point, he'll put a new engine into this one, and run it again. This was actually the car he raced at Fuji Speedway last year when I met him. You can check out that post <a href="http://domofactor.com/2012/05/japan-trip-day-8-370z-touge-fuji-speedway-karting-fuji-q-highland-daikokufuto/" target="_blank">here</a> for those interested!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9877" alt="DSC_0109" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01091.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This 4AG head was spotted with some head work getting done to it.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0108.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9876" alt="DSC_0108" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0108.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After checking out the shop we were getting hungry. So, Hideki, and I joined up with Natsuko who owned that black rx-7 up at Tsukuba Circuit, and they took me to a famous hamburger place that apparently is only in Shizuoka. One interesting note, is we took this Suzuki kei car below, which was turbo'ed! The dosing from the turbo totally surprised me! haha check out some video below for the awesome flutter sounds!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1270.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9891" alt="IMG_1270" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1270.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

The name of the place was Sayaka I believe, and while the style of hambuger was a little bit raw than what I would like, it was still suuuper good!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1274.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9895" alt="IMG_1274" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1274.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Since I didn't want to rush to Osaka that night, and it would be easier if I just left in the morning. Hideki and Natsuko were kind enough to set me up with a hotel for the night, since his place was too small.  lol <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1277.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9898" alt="IMG_1277" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1277.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I had a blast in shizuoka, and can't wait to come back to visit again! It was really similar to gunma where it was a bit country side, but really quiet, and not as packed as tokyo. lol
