so, today I was feeling a bit lazy, and didn't feel like venture out anywhere really. So, I mostly stayed inside during the day. lol I did go out a bit later in the afternoon though, so you can see that after the jump.

So, yesterday when I went to 7-11 for breakfast, I Accidentally stumbled on these french toast slices. I tried one, and they were so good I had to have them again this morning for breakfast. :p

Anyways, aside from that I didn't really do much today. I got caught up in all my anime, and was just on the computer for most of the day, until later in the afternoon.

Here's I'm waiting on my ex co-worker Brian to show up at Shinjuku Station. I think the train ride over there, was the most packed its ever been since me being here. You literally couldn't move anywhere. lol

We ended up going to this BBQ pork place called Tonchan and Â met up with Matsumoto-san who was another co-worker. Apparently though, this place is pretty famous.

we started off with these slices of pork, that is almost like a really thick bacon, but not as salty.

Then, we moved on to some fried rice which was really good. It was korea style, and I forgot the name.&gt;_&lt;

On the way back to the station, I saw this lantern and really wanted to take a picture for some reason. lol
