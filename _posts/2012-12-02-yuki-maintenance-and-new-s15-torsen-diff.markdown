Spent some time doing general maintenance this weekend on yuki as well as picking up a new differential! ^_^

I changed my oil, and when I decided to check some other things, I realized my spark plugs looked like this! 0_o

Replaced the Spark Plugs with a brand new set of NGK's, and now the motor runs alot smoother, and has better power. :p

Quick comparison of the two plugs. lol

After changing my plugs, I went out and picked up with S15 Torsen(Helical) Differential. It came with a set of new Nismo ring gear bolts, OEM s15 half-shafts, and OEM bearings. There's about 10k on the diff, so its already been broken in!

These ring bolts, had to be sent over from Japan since they don't stock them here in the US.

New bearings

everything all together, before it was installed.

For Those that don't know, the Tosen diff, or Helical style, is basically a 1 way diff. Check out the video below to see how it works. but basically, using a set of gears, if one wheel comes off the ground, or has less torque than the other, the load is shifted to that wheel. Using this diff for now instead of a clutch-type like OS Giken gives me the advantage of not having to do any maintenance other than change the oil, have a quiet diff since I still daily drive this car, but still provide a locked diff under accelleration to be able to do some drifting and grip driving.
