Day 11 was a bit less hectic than previous days, and I was hanging out most of the day with my friend Makoto.

First on the list of things to do was check out Tokyo Tower!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00075.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8632" title="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00075.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There was a pretty awesome view once we got up there.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00215.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8643" title="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00215.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had these sections where you could look down at the street below. Height wise, I'd say it was roughly the same as the space needle, or maybe even a bit lower down.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00164.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8638" title="DSC_0016" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00164.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had this cool little good luck charm wall all filled out.

Just outside of the Tokyo Tower, I spotted this awesome vending machine. For those of you who haven't seen the Tommy Lee Jones BOSS Coffee commercials, check out a few links below. You're missing out. haha

We decided to go to this Okonomiyaki place for lunch, where you make your own.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0345.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8623" title="aIMG_0345" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0345.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Luckily, they turned out okay. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0346.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8624" title="aIMG_0346" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0346-e1338447734928.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

One thing that's pretty cool, is this Suica card. You can use it for the JR Lines, Subways, and even at shops and vending machines inside the stations. It's basically just a reloadable card, so you don't have to buy tickets all the time. lol Next time, I'm for sure getting one of these guys.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00326.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8651" title="DSC_0032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00326.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next it was off to the shibuya area, to do some more exploring, and check out the giant crossing that I forgot to get a picture of last time. Once we got there, this Bentley was seen cruising by.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00335.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8652" title="DSC_0033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00335.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Here's a really popular shopping place that's been featured in lots of anime and j-drama

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00393.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8656" title="DSC_0039" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00393.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Calm before the storm. There was alot less people since this was during the day on a weekday.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00435.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8658" title="DSC_0043" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00435.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

aaaand everybody scrambles!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00476.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8660" title="DSC_0047" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00476.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Before leaving the Shibuya area, I got a picture of this statue of a dog named Hachiko. You can google more about the story, but its basically this dog that waited for an owner that never returned and its a very popular meetup spot in shibuya.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0348.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8626" title="aIMG_0348" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0348-e1338448052416.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After that, we headed over to Shinjuku to try some Dango. It was basically small mochi balls on a stick. The far left multi-colored one was strawberry, plain, and green tea. The middle type was Shoyu flavor which I didn't care for much, and the far right one was red bean which wasn't too bad.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0349.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8627" title="aIMG_0349" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0349.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After Dango, we still had some time to kill before Makoto had to go pickup her cousin from the train station, so we went to go see MIB3 which overall was an awesome movie, and wayy better than the second one. Japanese movie theatres are interesting though, their sizes obiously are wayy smaller than ours. Also, when buying your tickets, you have to pick specific seats you want, instead of just sitting wherever. lol

Anyways, that's about it. Tomorrow i've got nothing planned, so it will probably involve more downtime, and updating of the blog. lol
