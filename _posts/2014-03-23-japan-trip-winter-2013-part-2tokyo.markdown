hey guys,

Still working on trying to get this blog train rolling. Life has been hectic, so sorry for the slowness! :\ Anyways, lets pick up where we left off. The first section of my trip involved being up in Tsukuba for a few days. If you missed that post you can find it <a title="Japan Trip Winter 2013: Part 1(Tsukuba)" href="http://domofactor.com/2014/02/japan-trip-winter-2013-part-1tsukuba/" target="_blank">here</a>! After Tsukuba, I made my way back down town Tokyo for about a week.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2153.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10719" alt="IMG_2153" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2153.jpg" width="960" height="635" /></a>

<!--more-->So, my buddy Ken was nice enough to let me stay at his place again. This time, it was a bit closer towards Shinjuku which was nice. Aside from the occaisional wierdness like this, it wasn't all that bad and I had a great time! haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0273.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10785" alt="DSC_0273" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0273.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2161.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10711" alt="IMG_2161" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2161.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>My one condition for staying there was that I had to bring back some various snacks that you can't find in Japan. Somehow, Ken thought putting Queso Cheese dip, and Flamin Hot Cheetos together was the best thing since sliced bread. Sadly, his stomach thought otherwise later. haha

While in Tokyo, I made it a priority to visit as many people as I could. Since I was only there for a little under a week and had been there before. So, first person up on my hit list was my friend Teppei. We metup and grabbed some pretty good Okonomiyaki.<a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2158.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10714" alt="IMG_2158" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2158.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Afterwards, I went to a Music store to pickup some CD's since they're alot more expensive back in Seattle. lol
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2160.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10712" alt="IMG_2160" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2160.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

The next day I metup with my friend's Shin and Marina for some lunch. Surprisingly, the Italian food in tokyo is actually really awesome!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2169.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10703" alt="IMG_2169" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2169.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2170.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10702" alt="IMG_2170" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2170.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2176.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10696" alt="IMG_2176" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2176.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a>

On the way there, we spotted this random shop. Sometimes Tokyo never ceases to amaze me. :p
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10704" alt="IMG_2168" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2168.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

For dinner that day, I metup with my friend Eriko. I totally forget the name of the dish I had, but it was pretty good.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2167.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10705" alt="IMG_2167" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2167.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The next day I metup with Mai and Aya near their college which had some really nice looking tree's lightup at the entrance.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10699" alt="IMG_2173" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2173.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Apparently, this is Loco Moco? WHO PUTS LETTUCE IN THAT!?<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2175.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10697" alt="IMG_2175" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2175.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>I also thought it was pretty funny since the menu actually said Roco Moco. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2174.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10698" alt="IMG_2174" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2174.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2177.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10695" alt="IMG_2177" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2177.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Ken started getting alot into film, so he followed me around most of the following day with his camera setup. First stop was a place that was actually right next to the hotel I usually stay at in Meguro called Hungry Heaven. I've seen the sign a number of times walking by it, but i've never actually gone inside until now. haha The bugers are a bit expensve, but definitely tastey!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2188.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10687" alt="IMG_2188" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2188.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2186.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10689" alt="IMG_2186" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2186.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I totally forget where we went to after that since its been nearly 3-4 months after the fact, but this is what you end up dealing with in Tokyo...:( PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. this is the main reason I prefer quieter, countryside places. Cities have never really been my thing. lol
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10690" alt="IMG_2185" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2185.jpg" width="620" height="465" /><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10736" alt="DSC_0002" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0002.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While wandering around these things drove by..half mech half woman??<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2190.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10685" alt="IMG_2190" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2190.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

We Spotted this awesome tower in the distance, and thought it would be great to get some shots from there.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10734" alt="DSC_0004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0004.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Some of these buildings gave me vertigo just looking at them. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10732" alt="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0007.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0009.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10730" alt="DSC_0009" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0009.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

We finally got to the top(52nd floor I believe), and busted out the cameras. The crazy part was you can actually feel the building sway. I guess due to the earthquakes, its neccessary. I just thought it was interested, since its totally different compared to some of the bigger buildings in seattle.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10721" alt="DSC_0024" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10723" alt="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg" width="620" height="936" />
</a>

There were some really great views from up there, and its kind of mind blowing just how dense Tokyo is. You don't really get the big picture from the street, but once you go higher up like this, its pretty crazy.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10725" alt="DSC_0018" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0018.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10729" alt="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0010.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Still feeling pretty Energetic, I hopped on the train to Yokohama to visit my friend Derek again. Since, I had some time to kill, I wandered around, and found this place! :p<a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0319.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10754" alt="DSC_0319" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0319.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The Nissan Global Headquarters and Gallery Showroom!!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0339.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0339" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0339.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were mostly newer cars there, this didn't stop anybody from admiring great cars like the new 2014 GTR V-Spec, and 370Z convertible.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0308.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10759" alt="DSC_0308" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0308.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0281.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10782" alt="DSC_0281" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0281.jpg" width="620" height="410" />

They had this cool timeline things, that routed all over the showroom. As I followed it, I ran into something pretty cool...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10765" alt="DSC_0301" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0301.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had this sweet nismo ship filled with official nissan and nismo goodies!  <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_03061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10788" alt="DSC_0306" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_03061.jpg" width="620" height="410" />

I couldn't help myself and picked up a pair of new racing gloves! Sadly, I later learned that they are about 1 size too small..:(<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2183.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10691" alt="IMG_2183" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2183.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Nissan also had some great classics setup in the other corner of the show room as well!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0288.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10776" alt="DSC_0288" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0288.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0294.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10770" alt="DSC_0294" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0294.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I noticed they had some cars outside, and I stepped out onto the patio area, then realized there were some great scenery shots to be taken. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0338.jpg">
</a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0341.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10742" alt="DSC_0341" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0341.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0342.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10741" alt="DSC_0342" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0342.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0326.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10750" alt="DSC_0326" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0326.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I got a call from Derek saying he was at the train station, so I started heading back and taking more scenery shots along the way.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0313.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10756" alt="DSC_0313" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0313.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0334.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10747" alt="DSC_0334" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0334.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0344.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10739" alt="DSC_0344" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0344.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0337.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10745" alt="DSC_0337" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0337.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0315.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10755" alt="DSC_0315" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0315.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After getting some food we wandered around for a bit and stumbled on this 4-floor game center that was almost all filled with fighting games. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2181.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10692" alt="IMG_2181" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2181.jpg" width="620" height="826" />
</a>

The following day, I metup with my friend Chihiro who happened to be in town from Sendai for job hunting!
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2179.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10694" alt="IMG_2179" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2179.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a>

That pretty much ends my Tokyo leg of the trip. It was short, and I mainly was just hanging out with friends most of the time. haha This post was a bit short on car content, so sorry if it was a bit boring. lol I've got some good stuff coming up from Shizuoka and Fuji Speedway next. So, lets see if I can manage to upload that stuff quicker than a month this time around! :p heh
