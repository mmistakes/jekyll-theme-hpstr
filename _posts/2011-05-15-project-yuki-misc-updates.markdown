Hey guys,

Hopefully you all haven't run away from the lack of posts. I wanna thank everyone for giving me their input on the schedule. I've decided to go ahead and remove it so I stick to making posts at my leisure. This way, I'm not rushing or fighitng to come up with things to post. lol Anywho, I did some more work on Yuki this past weekend^_^ check it out!

Managed to fit my rear Tanabe strut bar on without even removing the interior panels!!

Also, a quick shoutout goes to Yuta Akaishi from the Japanese Drift Team HeartBreaker for offering these decals in return for donating to help those affected by the tsunami/eartquake in Japan. IF you have time, head on over to his blog atÂ <a href="http://yuta-akaishi.blogspot.com/">http://yuta-akaishi.blogspot.com/</a>

Took some pictures before heading into work for some overtime this past saturday. I finally got the rest of the type-x aero on! I've since lowered roughly an inch all the way around though.

another shot at 6am before work. :p

There are still 2 things with the car as a whole that I really need to fix. First is there's alot of backlash in my Kaaz 2-way. So, whenever I go around a tight corner with the clutch engaged it feels like the entire rear-end is going to explode. haha I'm going to pull it apart this coming weekend and check if the shims are on the right sides, if not hopefully it's just my final gear that got pwned. My buddy has a spare open diff, so I'll try stealing his pumpkin and seeing if that works.

The second thing is my transmission. The syncro's are worn pretty bad, and you really have to granny shift the thing everywhere. haha Although the brand new SPEC Clutch and Lightweight flywheel do make a big difference. I have a feeling that the 2-way smacking all over the place will eventually cause my tranny go get KO'ed as well. So, I'll be getting it rebuilt within the next month or so hopefully :p

Well... that's it for now. Hopefully once I finish getting the tranny rebuilt I can give Yuki some track time! haha
