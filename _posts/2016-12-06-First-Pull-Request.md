Most of the times, the road to your first pull request is often a hard one. You're frustated, you're tired with mind numbing toil and you just wanna do it and become a "real programmer". Somehow doing your first pull request make you feel like a real programmer, who made a contribution which someone reviewed and accepted. After doing this hardwork of learning from automated bots and books, and jumping from tutorial to tutorial, It finally feels like it all pays off when you see the "Pull request merged" message.

The only thing stopping you from doing your first pull request is yourself. If you're here for redemption and are having thoughts of quitting, let me remind you. I've been where you are right now, and let me remind you. Don't you ever quit. You might feel that you are too dumb or not made for this but no. Keep pushing yourself, you're not "that" dumb. Anyone with half a brain can do it. So trust me, go on and do that first pull request.

cheers.
