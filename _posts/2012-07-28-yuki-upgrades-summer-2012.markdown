Hey guys!

So i've finally gotten some time to make a progress report on Yuki since coming back from Japan! ^_^ More pictures, and shtuff after the jump!

Anyways, first thing up was to get my sound system in order. While having my 6x9 speakers in the rear, and 6" ones in the door was good, sometimes I like to hear bass without fear of killing my speakers. So, I enlisted the help of my buddy mike for some suggestions on getting a sub woofer

After checking out Mike's setup in his Toyota Celica, I decided I really liked it and wanted something similar. This is the Infinity Basslink 2.0, which is just a newer version of the one he has. One thing that I really liked about this unit, is the fact that it has the amp built into it, and also it features dual-sided 10" subs. Overall this setup is really nice because you can tune it to just have light bass(what I like) or crank it up, and get some really good hard hitting stuff.

Ignore my dirty hatch, and skateboard, but this is basically how it sits for now. Unfortunately, with the s13 hatch, there really isn't any good places to bolt stuff in the hatch without drilling. Seeing as my gas tank is there, I don't feel like doing that. haha The sub is heavy enough that is doesn't move around, but just incase I grabbed an old elastic belt I had, and wrapped it around the strut tower just to prevent it from playing pin-ball in my hatch. haha

After getting that little upgrade, my music sounds alot more complete, and it was time to move onto another minor project i've been putting off since wintertime. Which was, my coilovers. Remember those torsen bearings I installed when I did the swift springs + corner balance? well...I sort of neglected them and the winter time turned them into rusy bearings that popped everytime I turned the wheel at slow speeds or a standstill. This didn't jive very well with the ladies...so...I finally got it taken care of. haha

Here's a before shot of how they looked...not very pretty I know. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/old_bearings.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8753" title="old_bearings" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/old_bearings.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></a>

I think if I had greased these with something they would've lasted a bit longer. One thing that sort of concerned me is how the pressure from one of the springs actually cut into the washer there on the right. I'm not sure if that's a result of too much pre-load, so I'll have to double check the pre-load on my fronts next time I do an oil change or something.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/coilclean_after.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8755" title="coilclean_after" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/coilclean_after.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></a>

Here's everything all nice and clean. I ended up just putting the plastic washer back for now, as they don't make ugly popping noises, and work just fine for now. haha One thing I have to say, is I'm rather surprised with these Megan Racing coils. I've had them now since about 2009, and i've done track days as well as DD, and they've showed no signs of having any issues *knock on wood*. For 800 bucks, not a bad deal. Eventually I'd like to upgrade to some KW coils, but for now these will do just fine.^_^

Anyway, moving on, I decided I had enough of my brakes rusting up. Same thing started happening as before, and my passenger front caliper started rusting up again. So, I then made up my mind to go full aluminum for brakes, and made that as being my next priority. I looked through my options, and almost settled on doing a full Z32 swap with aluminum stuff, but then my buddy ricky mentioned some nonsense about Cadillac CTS-V brakes for the fronts. well...turns out he was right! 0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8758" title="yuki_ctsv_1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></a>

I picked up these set of 4-piston brembo's which are exactly the same caliper found on the EVO VIII for $150 bucks brand new from gmpartsdirect.com. Only downsite is it didn't come with the pins n stuff, so I had to order that from autozone for $20.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" title="yuki_ctsv_2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_2.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></a>

Using these plus a bracket that Mazworx makes for $100 bucks, and some Evo VIII pads and rotors, you have a bolt up kit in the front for the S13! This is basically the same performance wise as doing the Evo VIII brake swap, but for a fraction of the price! Also, one thing I liked is these calipers were already silver, so I wont have to paint them :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/z32_knuckles.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8759" title="z32_knuckles" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/z32_knuckles.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" /></a>

As for the rear, I decided to stick with an aluminum Z32 setup but swapping out stock Steel knuckles for some Z32 Aluminum ones. I plan to swap out the old bushings for some SPL spherical ones to get smoother suspension movement, and prevent binding. This enables me to still keep things simple swap wise since its very popular, as well as reduce some unsprung weight! Also, with this total setup, I'm able to get some aggressive pads all around. That was one big thing I sort of didn't like about the Q45 setup, is not a very wide range of pads to choose from in the front.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/project_mu_hcplus.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8760" title="project_mu_hcplus" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/project_mu_hcplus.png" alt="" width="577" height="891" /></a>

On that note, I plan to go with these Project Mu HC+ pads. I've ran Project Mu pads before in the past(B-Spec), and aside from the natural fade that occured while driving hard on stock s13 brakes, I felt like they dusted a bit too much. But, other than that I was very happy with them! Below you can see a nice chart showing their overall range of use, and these are the best pads in terms of temperature use! 0-800degree's is awesome! compared to the B-specs 0-500 temp.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8761" title="pmu_brake_chart" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="278" /></a>

Also, according to this chart, research i've done, and past experience with Project Mu pads, I'll get the best of both worlds in terms of having a good pad for both street and track use! ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8762" title="dba-4000-5000series-580x561" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="561" /></a>
As for rotors, I plan to go with these DBA 4000 series slotted rotors for now. I'd really love to rock 2-piece aluminum rotors as well, but they're a bit expensive and I would like to put that money into other things. haha

Going this route with the 4-piston CTS-V fronts and 2-piston Z32 rears actually helps out my overall brake bias. I was talking with Ken the other day about this, but realized some of my numbers were incorrect from memory and I had to re-calculate my numbers. For a reference, a stock s13 has a 70% brake bias towards the front. I have no chart for this anymore, and I'm too lazy to remake it. So, just trust me. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8763" title="s13_q45f_z31bmc" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png" alt="" width="290" height="543" /></a>

My current setup with a 15/16" BMC, and Q45 front calipers actually pushes me to 81% bias. This explains the big problem i've been having with the fronts locking up wayy too soon. I currently Have Federal 595's which are a pretty decent tire, so its not a matter of having some crappy all-season tire. lol I don't have ABS, so I do expect there to be some lockup if you just slam on the brakes obviously. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8764" title="ctsv_z32_1516" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png" alt="" width="281" height="533" /></a>

Switching to this CTS-V front and Z32 rear setup, actually settles things back down to a solid 74%. I think this will feel better overall and help balance the car out alot more under hard braking.

Along with this, I plan to get a new sit of Dunlop Direzza Star Specs, which should also help provide a bit more grip as well under braking. Especially because for camber I'm running 3 degrees in the front and 2 in the rear. So, straight line braking isn't as great as it could be. I've also been tossing around the idea of trying a new set of wheels. Possibly some Enkei RPF-01's due to them being Forged, alot lighter than my current wheels, and balancing out a bit nicer. We'll see about those though a bit later on in the summer.

Anyways, I've got the calipers already for the brake stuff, so now its just a matter of collecting all the remaining pieces, and bolting everything on! Getting this brake stuff finished up is my main goal for this summer. Once that's taken care of, I have some suspension bits, I'd like to replace before finally stashing away the rest of my money for importing an ae86, and my sr20vet motor swap in yuki! ^_^
