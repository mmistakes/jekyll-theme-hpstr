I'm about 3 days behind on these, so bear with me.. &gt;&lt; I didn't have much going on this day, so my friend's wife Satomi took me around the neighborhood and did some exploring.

We started out my hopping on a bike, and heading out. it was abut a 15-20 minute ride, and to make matters worse it was hot and humid..T_T

Along the way we stopped off at a grocery store to pick up some things, when i noticed these little containers with stuff swimming around in them. lol turned out it was these little guys! I have a pretty cool video of them down below.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9729" alt="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00052.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> Another thing that blew me away is how cheap all of the drinnks I usually buy in seattle are! This was abour $1.50 here, and I pay around $3.50-$4 for it usually at uwajimaya.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00092.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9731" alt="DSC_0009" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00092.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

My friend shunji's dream come true. A wall of pringles!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00122.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9734" alt="DSC_0012" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00122.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

My haul of groceries which consisted of some Orange chicken, salad, pizza bread, pizza, and CC Lemon.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9735" alt="DSC_0013" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0013.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After doing some more riding we ran into this stray cat, who didn't see to like people very much. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9738" alt="DSC_0017" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00173.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Japanese School! Its interesting to note the difference in size of the ones towards the outskirts of the cirty, compared to the ones right downtown.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00193.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9740" alt="DSC_0019" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00193.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They have a ton of these Daihatsu's here, and they remind me exactly of the old mini coopers. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9744" alt="DSC_0023" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00232.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After doing some more riding I was able to snap a quick shot of this nice WRX STI as it drove by.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00242.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9745" alt="DSC_0024" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00242.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Then, I got super lucky as there was a red light behind me. So, I ran up to have a quick chat and take a picture. Also, dude was shinin out of control, literally. lol I didnt realize there was that hard of a glare from his watch until I went back to look at the photo's.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9747" alt="DSC_0026" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After touring around the Musashino area, we headed over to Mikata and then Kichijoji, when I spotted this cool old school looking car. I have no idea what it is though, so if somebody could fill me in that would be great.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00372.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9756" alt="DSC_0037" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00372.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Even though I see R32's all the time now here or in canada, the "ahh such an awesome car" effect still doesn't wear off on me. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0039.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9758" alt="DSC_0039" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0039.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Barely managed to get a quick snap of this guys neat looking bike. The tires on this were super meaty.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00412.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9760" alt="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00412.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to park out bikes after a while using this contraption. Basically, the guy gives you a card, you hand him you hand,  and it gets sucked off into the abyss by this machine. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00452.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9763" alt="DSC_0045" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00452.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

It was starting to get later towards dinner time, and the amount of people started noticeable increasing...&gt;&lt;<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00492.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9766" alt="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00492.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Before heading home, we made a quick stop at this very specific museum. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00541.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9771" alt="DSC_0054" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00541.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

More strange things coming from inside this meseum! any takers on what it is? :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9773" alt="DSC_0056" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00561.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Spotted this super clean Toyota Crown(I think) with some VIP fitment.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00572.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9774" alt="DSC_0057" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00572.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also, right next to it was the polar opposite. Flush BMW M3, with some gofast aero bits.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00581.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9775" alt="DSC_0058" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00581.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This lonely R33 was also spotted, and it looked like it hadn't been used in a while..:(<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00591.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9776" alt="DSC_0059" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00591.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Later on towards the end of the day I head this sound like "eeeeeemoooooo" "yaaaaaakkkkkiiiii eeeeemoooo" when I went to investigate it was a random japanese sweet potatoe truck. These are usually really popular during the fall/winter, so I guess its kind of rare to get one during the summertime. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00621.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9779" alt="DSC_0062" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00621.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00651.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9781" alt="DSC_0065" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00651.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>
