Over the past 6-9 months i've been saving and piecing together parts for Yuki's new engine. Naturally, its only fitting that the platform is a SR20DET blacktop from a 1997 180sx Type-X. :p

With that said, lets kick things off so I can start going over what's all there and how the build went!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10833" alt="gtx3" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

So, lets first start of with the motor itself. It was originally owned by my fried Joe, who was running it in his S14. However, after that got totalled out, he remembered I was looking for an SR to swap in soon, and cuz me an amazing deal. Some things already done to the motor when I got it were:
-Eagle rods
-CP Pistons(86.5mm)
-Apexi Headgasket(87x.8mm)
-APR Headstuds
-Greddy Rocker Arm Stoppers
-Garage Autohero Engine Balancing and Head Port
-Nismo FPR and Nismo 550cc injectors
-Nismo Waterpump
-S15 T28 Turbo
-Megan Racing Exhaust Manifold
-Noname downpipe elbow
-Apexi AFC Neo
-Spec Stage 3 full-sprung 6-puck clutch
-Fidanza Flywheel

Since Joe's car was currently sitting at my friend Ricky's shop, so was the motor after it was pulled. One weekend I had some freetime, and figured I'd better start working on tearing everything down. So, I went to pick it up, and take the motor and tranny down to my house.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10829" alt="DSC_0015" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg" width="474" height="313" />

Literally that following week, the thermostat on my KA got stuck, and while trying to limp my car home while overheating the headgasket gave out..:( It wasn't the best motor, and had its annoying times, but I had no major issues with it, and it had served me well since 2007!

So, now without having a car and taking the train to work and I finally got going on things with the SR. First, I needed to go pickup an engine stand so I had something to work on. lol
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10870" alt="1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a>

Next I got the motor all strapped up, and over to the stand.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10871" alt="1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg" width="474" height="474" />
</a>

After getting all the turbo side stuff removed, it was time to clean things up a bit. Here's a quick before shot.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10842" alt="1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg" width="720" height="540" />
</a>

aaand the after
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10841" alt="1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg" width="720" height="540" /></a>

One things were all clean I started getting the turbo side pieced back together. Replacing the T28 turbo was this shiney guy. A brand new Garrett GTX2867r .64A/R. This turbo is essentially a middle step between Garrett's famous GT2871r and GT3076. The problem you're faced with these two turbo's, is you're forced to make a choice. go for low-end power, but quick spool and response. Or, deal with more turbo lag, and more top end power, but longer spool and response.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10833" alt="gtx3" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

While still being a bottom mounted T2 series turbo, it certain has its limitations, like interal wastebate, and maybe not making as much top end power as the T3 series. But, you'll be surprised when you see the numbers later on. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10834" alt="gtx4" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

To make sure I was getting the most out of this turbo, I contacted the guys over at DOC Race since they're relatively local, and seem to do great work! They offer a bottom mount style T2 series manifold that's hand made, but also an external wastegate flange! This will allow me to more reliably run higher levels of boost, without chances of leaks.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10872" alt="T25-Mock-up-1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg" width="600" height="411" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10873" alt="T25-Mock-up-2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg" width="474" height="340" /></a>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10827" alt="doc3" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Now, when converting internal wastegate over to internal, alot of people weld the flapper shut. But, if i'd like to sell this turbo in the future, that might be an issue. So, I did some searching and turns out they make a locker bracket for this type of things over at COBB Tuning for Subaru's. I don't have a Subaru, but a turbo is a turbo, regardless of the car its on.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10828" alt="DSC_0001" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

One thing however, is I never got a e-clip with this turbo since it was new, and I tried finding some different ones at Ace Hardware, but didn't have any luck. I did pick up some of these little metal clips, and they seem to be doing just fine after 3 months.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10838" alt="998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg" width="720" height="960" />
</a>

Picked up this Copper style gasket<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10874" alt="IMG_1900" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg" width="474" height="355" /></a>

I got everything bolted up to check clearances and lines<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10844" alt="1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" />
</a>

The wastegate i'm running is a Tial MVS w/ v-band flanges

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10823" alt="249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" />
</a>

One interesting piece I later found out, is According to <a title="Tial's website" href="http://www.tialsport.com/documents/MVSspc.png">Tial's website</a>. This combination of Black and Red springs should equal 1bar(roughly 14.5psi). However, turns out for some reason, this is actually 1.37bar(20psi). haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10845" alt="1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I then got everything mocked up to make sure it would fit. I was originally a bit concerned with the dump pipe clearing the steering column, and would later make some small adjustments.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10853" alt="1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a></span>

&nbsp;

For exhaust related pieces, I decided to go with the Powered by MAX Cobra Downpipe. This makes the turbo elbow and downpipe all into one piece, while adding a flex section. The one thing I didn notice with this is you ABSOLUTELY must run the transmission bracket for the downpipe or else your exhaust is going to sag alo!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10830" alt="DSC_0059" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0077" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

&nbsp;

The buddy club exhaust sounded great(being able to hear my turbo through exhaust is the best sound in the world). but the fitment left a bit to be desired, and I needed something just a tad quieter since I still daily my car. So, I went back to the old trust Megan Racing Drift Spec that I had on my KA for about 5 years, this time in a 3" for the SR.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10859" alt="1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg" width="960" height="720" /></a>

Now on to some misc intake and exhaust related things. I picked up this Stance oversized water pump pulley since I know SR's are notorious for overheating. I also picked up this neat Mishimoto radiator cap that also has a temp guage in it, which has proved very userful. Also a HKS SSQV blowoff valve, which sounds great!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10837" alt="misc_intake" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg" width="474" height="715" /></a>
Got the Greddy Type-LS front mount all mocked up. I have to say, comparing this to other kits such as CX racing and other off brand ones, paying the extra bit of money to have the fitment be dead on is totally worth it! haha The only thing I had to do with this kit was drill out the hole in the battery tray!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10855" alt="1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg" width="720" height="540" /></a>
I did have to remove my front bumper support. Since I don't have the proper tools to cut the USDM one, i'll either do it later, or try to pick up a JDM one. ;)Also, its worth noting, I had to trim a few plastic pieces off the back of the type-x bumper, but nothing too crazy.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10856" alt="995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg" width="720" height="540" />
</a>

One thing that I really wanted to do was keep this car reliable. So, instead of fully building the head, I decided to just keep the internals stock, and upgradae the cams to Jim Wolf Technology S3HL cams.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10836" alt="IMG_1681" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg" width="474" height="355" /></a>

One thing I found helped out alot when doing this, was just zip tying the chain to the sprocket so my timing didn't get out of place. Then, to prevent the sprockets from falling down too far into the motor, I just put a socket extention down the hole to block things.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10875" alt="IMG_1941" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

Got everything apart, and inspecting stuff for any issues/wear<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10847" alt="1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

Here you can see the lobe difference compared to stock which feature a 272 Duration, and an uncommon 11.5mm of lift. This will prevent me from being forced to the solid lifters like with most 12mm setups.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10890" alt="1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg" width="474" height="632" />
</a>

Staying with the head side of things, one common issue I've seen alot of with S13 valve covers, is oil blowby. So, I decided to pick up this S13.4 valve cover. The front half is s13, the rest is s14 due to it having better oil baffles in the valve cover.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10848" alt="1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

To make things cleaner I picked up this Tomei spark plug cover, and also some other misc parts like heater core conversion hoses, since I daily this car and would like heat during the winter time. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10843" alt="1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

Lastly, I picked up this Radium Engineering catch can to filter out all the crap before it goes into my turbo. I'm not running it at the moment, since I still need to pickup some more AN fittings and line, but i'm looking forward to seeing how much it picks up.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10893" alt="1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg" width="720" height="960" /></a>

Now, lets move over to Fuel/Engine Mgmt! The harness I'm running is Chase Bays and to be honest, had less than stellar quality with them. I'll explain a bit later on that though.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10835" alt="IMG_1676" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg" width="474" height="474" /></a>

Here's one thing I noticed right off the bad. when installing my Power Enterprises 850cc injectors.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10825" alt="599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

&nbsp;

Here you can see the normal SR injector plug, with these offset slots. however...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10888" alt="IMG_2029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg" width="474" height="355" /></a>

The injectors I got came with the slots even with each other. This is different compared to the old Nismo injectors I pulled, which were offset like the plug.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10889" alt="IMG_2028" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

&nbsp;

The fix I did for this was to just bust out a file, and grind down one side of the injector the following two directions.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10887" alt="IMG_2030" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10886" alt="IMG_2031" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

Once its ground down like this, the plug fits right on with no issues. I might throw some zipties or something around these though going forward. Since, after doing some doughnuts recently, I had one of my injectors pop off.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10885" alt="IMG_2032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg" width="474" height="355" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10884" alt="IMG_2033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10883" alt="IMG_2034" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

For Boost Levels and A/F's I'm running AEM Tru-Boost and AEM EUGO gauges. There's a few advantages to this. With the Tru-Boost gauge, it also doubles as a boost controller while providing a few options such as scramble boost(not using this quite yet, but might in the future), and over boost detection(kick down to wastegate pressure if it detects boost pressure getting too high). Also, the EUGO controller, allows me to run A/F data directly to the gauge, then from there send it to my ECU. Also, FYI I not running a MAF setup since its relatively old technology, and I figured its smarter and more reliable to go with a MAP setup. So I picked up an AEM 3bar MAP and IAT sensor.

I ended up just running this dual-gauge pillar. However, I ran my wires a bit differently than most. Instead of cutting/drilling into my dash or pillar, I simply disconnected the plastic hose behind my cluster, and ran the wires up through the vent!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg">

To make life easier and add flexibility later down the road, I picked up a full standalone EMS series 2 ECU from AEM. I debated picking up haltech, but a majority of tuners in my area can do AEM. So, that was the difference maker, aside from the various plug-n-play sensors and gauges.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10826" alt="AEM-EMS2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

One thing worth noting, is with the AEM ECU, you also need to run the CAS trigger wheel they supply with it.

At some point(this is 4 months afterwards) I made the call to start pulling the trusty old KA, and drop in the SR.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10849" alt="996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

One thing I sort of forgot to do, was plug the back of the transmission..&gt;&lt; the result was a lake of tranny fluid all over my garage floor. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10850" alt="1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

I then got the front stuff of the motor wrapped up with the Stance pulley and GKtech fan for more colling. One thing I later found out, is once that nismo thermostat kicks open, its a bit difficult to get any heat in this thing. haha I'll report back how things are after some track days. but, so far for daily driving anyways, it takes quite a while to warm up, and is only at the first bar on the stock temp gauge. I'll probably pick up an aftermarket water and oil temp gauge shortly as well.

For even more cooling, I picked up this Koyo radiator.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10894" alt="1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

With the KA out, I figure it was a good time to cleanup my engine bay. Sadly, it instantly got just as dirty right away, so that as a bit of a waste. I really need to plug the big holes near the firewall..:\<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10851" alt="1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg" width="720" height="540" /></a>

Here's the overall finished product!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10858" alt="995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg" width="540" height="720" /></a>

For my battery I just ran this little Odyssey battery, and seems to be fine as long as I fire up the car once every other day. If it goes more than a full day, it will go dead. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10910" alt="10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a>

I threw in this bottle until I could get my intake piping for the turbo made. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10882" alt="IMG_2035" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

Once I had the SR in, I did notice a few clearance things. First off, the space for the wastegate is pretty cramped, but looks just barely clears. I rubbed it up against the firewall when I dropped the motor in, so that's what the mark is from.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10880" alt="IMG_2004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg" width="474" height="355" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10881" alt="IMG_2003" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

The other issue, is dealing with the dump pipe. Taking this thing on/off is seriously a huuuge pain, and I actually had to have the pipe angled down to a 45 degree angle, instead of a 90 for more clearance for the steering rack and because it was hitting up against the brake booster. My one gripe right now, is its not long enough, and could use another 45 degree bend at the end, and a straight section so it blows more towards the back end of the steering rack and not directly on it so much.

After finally getting everything in and buttoned up, I seemed to have a pretty annoying issue. The car had fuel and compression while cranking over, but absolutely ZERO spark. I went through all the basics and was pulling my hair out. I was about to leave to japan in a matter of a few weeks, so I called up Alex over at <a title="Carb Connection" href="http://www.carbconn.com/" target="_blank">Carb Connection</a> to see if he could sort the car out for me while I was on vacation. luckily, he obliged, and I arranged for Yuki to get towed down to their shop.

This post is already getting a bit long, so i'll continue things in part 2! :)
