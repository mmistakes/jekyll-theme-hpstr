So, my friend Shunji had some stuff he wanted me to give his girlfriend Chihiro while she was in Tokyo, so we metup and grabbed dinner at this awesome place called Ninja Izakaya in Akasaka!

It took a bit of search for us to actually find the place, so I snapped some scenery shots in the meantime. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1238.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9828" alt="IMG_1238" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1238.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

When we finally found it, there was just this random mysterious looking door, with no real sign. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1240.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9830" alt="IMG_1240" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1240.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

When we first arrived, a ninja popped out of the wall, and escorted us through this dark maze of draw bridges. Finally when we got to our table, our menu was brought out on a scroll! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9831" alt="IMG_1241" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1241.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Here's a really crappy picture of the room we were in which has closeable doors.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1243.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9833" alt="IMG_1243" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1243.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The food was a tad expensive and small, but it tasted awesome! This was like a hotpot with rice underneath. There were mushrooms in it, which I don't usually care for, but in this case I couldn't taste them at all. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1246.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9835" alt="IMG_1246" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1246.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Along the way heading back to the station I spotted this clean S15. :p I totally failed though, and didn't get a picture of us to send to my friend shunji. &gt;&lt; haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1251.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9838" alt="IMG_1251" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1251.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>
