After spending many hours in frustration over the weekend and the past couple days, I've finally completed my CTS-V/Z32 brake swap! write-up and more pics after the jump!
いまはちょっといそがしいから。あとで、にほんごかきますよ！;)

Note: If you haven't checked out my progress posts regarding the brake swap, its worth doing so! there's some good information regarding z32 anchor bolts, brake bias, and other stuff!

Overall, doing a full brake overhaul of this caliber for under 2k is a great deal IMO. Especially considering a set of front STI or EVO Brembo calipers will run you 300-400 bucks for a set of used ones. I could have cut costs even more by getting a set of used z32 calipers or some cheaper pads both front and rear. But, I felt it was important to get as much new parts as possible to start fresh.

Here's a quick shot of the driver's side before the swap

I got started with taking everything apart, but forgot the one cardinal rule when it comes to taking LCA's off of the knuckle. When you pound on a ball joint or anything with threads for that matter....ALWAYS LEAVE THE NUT ON!!! I forgot this sadly, and by the time I realized what I had done...it was too late. bye-bye nismo LCA..:( I'll replace the balljoin eventually, but for now I needed a new one ASAP!

I managed to get a replacement after searching around for a couple days from Greg over at <a href="http://www.feltonautoparts.com/default.htm" target="_blank">Felton's Auto Parts</a> here in Snohomish,WA. I managed to get a new LCA with the balljoint and bushing already pressed in for about $60! 0_o

I forgot to take a picture of the new LCA, but its nothing special really. Once I got that, I was able to keep chugging away at the swap.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8881" title="DSC_0192" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

I was a little bit confused with how the bracket went on at first. I had thought it went behind the knuckle initially, so I got out my dremel to start gruming away the extra chunk of metal, then realized it didn't need to be done. Mazworx didn't send any instructions for how the bracket goes, and which bolt goes where, but after a little bit of playing with it, I was able to figure it out. This is how the bracket should fit on the passenger side.

<strong>Upper knuckle hole(non threaded hole on bracket) = longest bolt</strong>

<strong>Lower knuckle hole = smallest bolt</strong>

<strong>Bottom hole on bracket = medium size bolt</strong>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8885" title="DSC_0185" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

The only real unexpected hiccup I ran into with this swap was having to grind down these ribs on the caliper in order for the bracket to fit.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8882" title="DSC_0191" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On this caliper, I just used a small electric dremel, but it took a little while. So, I ran next door and borrowed my neighbors 6" bench grinder for the next one, which made quick work of the soft aluinum!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8883" title="DSC_0189" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The bracket should sit flush like so

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8884" title="DSC_0188" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

another angle of how the bracket should sit for the passenger side caliper.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8886" title="DSC_0184" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

old and busted. Note the rust on this caliper even though its probably only 6 months old...just another great reason to switch to aluminum.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0197.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8878" title="DSC_0197" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0197.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

new hotness!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0196.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8879" title="DSC_0196" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0196.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I did run into one issue with the Z32 conversion lines in the front, and the angle they have to take coming out of the caliper. Because they ended up being a bit too long and didn't seem to flow very smoothly, I ended up retaining my Q45 lines since they have a 90 degree bend in them. When I get time, I'll take a picture of it so you can see how I routed things to prevent it from rubbing on anything, or getting stretched at full lock. props go to my buddy john though for thinking of this idea. Before, I had them routed slightly different, and it wasn't as ideal.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ctsv_lines1.jpg"><img title="ctsv_lines1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ctsv_lines1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /></a>

here you can see the 90 degree inward bend I was talking about, and how with a straight stainless line running downward, it might cause some problems.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ctsv_lines2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8905" title="ctsv_lines2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ctsv_lines2.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /></a>

I attached the lines to the upper portion of the knuckle using a few zipties, and the metal connector section of the brake line to prevent any rubbing issues.

Before shot of the stock s13 brakes in the rear. This one was pretty straightforward since the Z32 swap stuff is already pretty well documented. One interesting tidbit, is I was able to get to the bolts for the knuckle by just removing all the the suspension arms, pulling out the axel a bit from the hub, and getting a stocket with an extension inside the half-circle grooves on the axel.

Another thing I found out, is I was able to also replace the ebrake brackets without taking the driveshaft or center console out. Just make sure you loosen the adjuster nut on your ebrake handle all the way so you can re-attach the new lines easier. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0207.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8875" title="DSC_0207" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0207.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

quick comparson shot of the rear rotors. I totally forgot to do this with the fronts, but up above are the old Q45 fronts which are 11.5" rotors. The Z32 rears are 11", and the stock s13 ones are 10". My fronts with the Evo VIII rotors are now 13"! ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0208.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8874" title="DSC_0208" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0208.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Got everything bolted up with no issues, and the ebrake works perfectly.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8871" title="DSC_0211" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0211.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

got everything tightened down, and bled! Time to go bed in the pads, and test everything
<h4>Impressions</h4>
First off, I'll explain that these brakes barely even stopped when I first pulled out of the driveway. I just did a few test stops from 10mph, and naturally there wasn't much bite there. I proceeded to drive around my neighborhood, and did about 10-15 stops with medium braking from 30mph and about 20-30 seconds between each stop. After that, I left the brakes cool down for about 5 minutes. then went out and did about 5-10 stops from 45-50mph with another 30 seconds between each one. I'd say just before I switched to the 50mph stops is when I felt the brakes really start biting, and working properly.

Overall, these stopping power this swap provides is AMAZING! the brake balance for this swap when combines with my 15/16" Brake Master Cylinder feels perfect! when I really lay into the brakes, I'm able to modulate the pressure pretty well compared to just instantly locking like i've heard with some full Z32 swaps. One thing to take note of, is these pads because they're meant to be used in both track and street applications, they have a slight squeel to them when coming to a stop. But, anybody that's owned high performance pads similar to Hawk HP+ or something similar will understand what i'm talking about. I also noticed that the the steering seems to be a tad bit heavier in the front. I think if I had gone with some 2pc rotors, that would have kept the feeling about the same. So, possibly switching to that, as well as some lighter forged wheels in the future will help with eliminating some of that.

My one complaint, is compared to my Q45 brakes, there's a bit less pedal pressure. But, I think it'll just take some getting used to. There's still pretty good pressure, just not what i'm used to from before. I'm going to run everything for this week, then sometime next weekend, I'll do a final flush of everything using my Motul fluid. I found out, I had some extra fluid laying around. so, instead of using my Motul, I used that stuff for now.
