Picking up from where I left off over in <a title="Part 1" href="http://domofactor.com/2014/03/yuki-boosted-goodness-part-1/">Part 1</a>, The initial build of my SR was finished. But, I was running into some spark issues.

<!--more-->After I came back from japan during the holidays, sadly they were still fighting the no spark issue over at <a title="Carb Connection" href="http://www.carbconn.com/">Carb Connection</a>. until things were working, I really was getting really annoyed not having any wheels, so I rented this sweet ride for most of the month of January 2014.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1495557_10202503290971000_1055407403_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10895" alt="1495557_10202503290971000_1055407403_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1495557_10202503290971000_1055407403_n.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></a>

The main issues ended up being two things.
1) the wiring for the chasebays harness was bad, and some of the CAS pins came out from the ecu plug.
2) the car then would run on only 3 cyclinders, but still had no spark on #4. After sending the ecu down to AEM, we later found that the ignition coil drivers was bad, and AEM swapped out the board.

During this whole fiasco the Chase Bays support was very unimpressive IMO. They had really crappy phone reception wherever their office was located at, and when asking for some help after explaining my situation, they just blamed it on the ecu. Another issue i've ran into, that i'll take pictures on, is a few things:

1) my speed sensor plug is wayy too short, and will never reach back towards the speed sensor area of the tranny
2) their documentation on their site is out of date, and wasn't helpful when comparing it against the harness they sent me when I was trying to verify which plugs went where, and checking wiring things.
3) I still have no clue what the "proper" way to route this harness is. Currently, I have it going through the runners. Basically, above the lower intake manifold, but below the upper one. Part of the issues this causes, is I can't really hook up my Knock Sensor since its too short to go around the lower intake manifold.

All that being said, I ended up running a combination of harnesses. A wiring specialties lower harness, which would connect up to all the tranny plugs, and run power to my alternator and starter. However, with the way the Chase Bays was designed, it eliminates the lower harness. So, I currently don't have any speed or reverse lights working..:\ I'll probably at some point swap out the chase bays harness for a Wiring Specialties one maybe. We'll see..

ANYWAYS, after sorting out all those issues and wierdness, we finally got the car running and up on the dyno!

Once we finally got some heat into the thing, we put it through its paces, and maan this thing sounds great! There was some wierd spark breakup at high rpms, which we later found to be because the spring I had in my wastegate actually was 20psi. So, when setting the tru-boost levels, things went a bit wierd. Once we disabled the solenoid, and just went off of wastegate pressure, everything smoothed out.

Here's the numbers I ended up with. Initially I was pretty pleased, and these were about ballpark of what I was expecting. I'm not quite sure why it went really lean there around 4k rpm.

Overall the car ran smooth, but it ate up gas like there was no tomorrow. I was filling up maybe every 3 days. Realizing this way wayy wrong, I took the car down to Bob over at <a title="Drift Office" href="http://www.driftoffice.com/">Drift Office</a> to see what he could do to try and lean the thing out.

Not only did he lean it out and make things much smoother, I had more power, and a much better curve overall! He also let me know some issues I was having with my CAS, and threw in some new spark plugs to boot!

With this setup, its alot better. I average about 40miles per day commuting to work, and fill up about once every 5-6 days. There's still a bit more tweaking that can probably be done to get more MPG's, but for running <strong>370hp@20psi w/ 318 ft-lbs of torque</strong>, i'm not complaining. :p

I later bugged Galen Callahan who's a friend of Ricky's to make up an intake tube for my turbo, and weld in an AN bung for when I throw in my catch can. He had done great with some some small work with my dump pipe and intake tubing which came out great, so I wanted to go back.

Overall, I'm really happy with this setup, and so far its been very daily friendly. with this turbo setup, I basically have full spool on tap at 3k when i'm on the freeway, so as soon as I get on it in 5th gear, its right there on tap! I'll be heading out to take Yuki to her first drift event after dropping this new motor in. So, i'll report back later on how things go there!
