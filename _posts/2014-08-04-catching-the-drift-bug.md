So, after doing just a handful of drift days here and there over the course of 2012 and 2013 I started to want to get out there more and more. Before I knew it, I caught the drift bug.

In the beginning of 2014 I made it over to Evergreen Speedway for one of their Open Drift events for the first time. Overall, I had a good time, and met some awesome people.

However, due to the amount of waiting to drive, and general format of how things went, I wanted to drive somewhere else other than Evergreen Speedway. Also, I felt like only driving once a year just made it really hardin general to improve.

I'd heard of a cool tight technical track similar to Ebisu and experienced briefly over at PGP. But, being roughly 3 hours south, I was hesistent to make the trip incase something broke. One day I decided to throw caution out the window and not worry about crap I can't control.

So, I packed up some tires with my friend Kyle Robertson from [Krafted Photography](https://www.facebook.com/pages/KRafted-Photography/321167974652177), stopped by to pick up another buddy and headed down to [Pat's Acres Racing Complex(PARC)](http://parcdrift.com) 30 minutes south from Portland in Canby,OR.

One thing I quickly realized, the line was about the same as evergreen. However, the time during your actual run was longer, and time between runs was shorter. This meant more laps, more seat time, and more learning!

Aside from seat time, another thing that this track presented was a wide range of techniques and car control.Instead of just doing 3 turns, you had up to 10 turns all of different types. Due to this, It took some getting used to, and I ended up learning the hard way. :p

After getting into a fight with some bushes, I decided it was a good time to take a lunchbreak and checkout the damage. Luckily, I came away with only minor stuff so onward I drove. Unluckily however, I broke my the center section of my type-x valence...which nissan doesn't sell anymore. ><

After a few warm-up laps I really started to settle in and get some quality lines going along with some dirt-drops here and there!

As the track dried out, I could really feel the speed start coming in, especially on the longer sweeper section. but.....then the rain came back. But, this time...with a vengence...

Instead of waiting for the rain to letup, everybody said skrew it, and forged on through the giant lakes that im supposed to call puddles. lol

As expected, I sucked my first time down there having only driven 3 times over the course of 2 years. But, it was a good way to knock off the rust at a low speed while still having fun.

Its hard to put into words just how awesome this track was, and you can tell by the smile on my face how much fun I had. It definitely reminded me alot of some of the tight and technical sections of Ebisu from when I did the drift school out there.

I took a quick stop through Portland on the way home after the event to recover a bit and grab some food. One thing I realized..3.5 hours to an event, driving, then driving 3.5 hours back all in the same day is pretty damn tiring. Either way though, I was excited for a bunch more events that were about to come during the summertime!
