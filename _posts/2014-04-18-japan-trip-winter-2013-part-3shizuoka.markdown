So, kicking things back off was my venture down south of Tokyo. First stop was Shizuoka! I'm gonna do this a bit backwards, and show you my last day first, and then the first day last. There's a reason for this, which you'll see later. :p

<!--more-->First off, I picked up this AMAZING strawberry bread thing before heading to the train station
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2195.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10963" alt="IMG_2195" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2195.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Then it was onto the bullet train to make my way down to Shizuoka! I still get kind of freaked out when these things go through the stations and don't stop. For obvious reasons, its not at full speed, but they're still moving pretty damn fast. lol
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2192.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10962" alt="IMG_2192" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2192.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a> <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2191.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10961" alt="IMG_2191" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2191.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

fast forward, and my buddy Ken and his wife Satomi were visiting Satomi's family in Shizuoka for the holidays and invited me out to cruise up in the mountains. So, I hopped on a local train about 10 minutes north to this tiny station to meetup with them.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2224.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10975" alt="IMG_2224" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2224.jpg" width="612" height="816" />

</a>The weather didn't look that great, and I thought it was going to rain, but luckily it didnt.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10976" alt="IMG_2225" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2225.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Before heading into the mountains, we stopped off to get some Udon for lunch.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2228.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10979" alt="IMG_2228" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2228.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Then after driving for about 30min-1hour before coming across this crazy suspension bridge.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0110.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10958" alt="DSC_0110" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0110.jpg" width="474" height="715" />
</a>

The views were actually awesome, but man that bridge was sketchy as hell.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0084.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10944" alt="DSC_0084" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0084.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0086.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0086" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0086.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0092.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10950" alt="DSC_0092" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0092.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

You can see just exactly how wide this thing was, and there were quite a bit of planks that were rotting away or had holes in them. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0090.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10948" alt="DSC_0090" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0090.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

we finally managed to get across without dying..<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0094.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10951" alt="DSC_0094" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0094.jpg" width="474" height="313" />
</a>

then, decided to do some exploring
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0097.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10953" alt="DSC_0097" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0097.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Of course being Shizuoka, there were tons of tea leaves everywhere <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0096.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10952" alt="DSC_0096" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0096.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

But also some really great views.<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0102.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10954" alt="DSC_0102" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0102.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

On the way back this girl was wearing heels and a short dress thingy..I'm not complaining but wasn't the best of choices. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0116.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10960" alt="DSC_0116" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0116.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

I actually got honked at when I took this as there was a train behind me. :p haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10959" alt="DSC_0111" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0111.jpg" width="474" height="313" />
</a>

Heading back down towards town, I started to get carsick, so we stopped at a rest area and swapped places so I could drive.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2229.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10980" alt="IMG_2229" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2229.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

At the rest area, there was this super wierd toll-ish thingy.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2231.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10982" alt="IMG_2231" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2231.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Okay, now that we got the ending part of shizuoka over, lets rewind to the beginning. Everytime I go there, its to meetup with Hideki who helps his dad run Garage Miura which specializes in AE86's, Mini's, Daihatsu's and tons of other small/kei cars. I metup with him and his sister Yukako at Sawayaka who later introduced me to their friend Yuya and his wife(whos name I cant remember).

The Hamburger there never dissappoints, and I can't wait to go back again this year in 2014! ^_^ oh, they give you those paper "shields" to prevent the grease from splashing on you. lol
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10964" alt="IMG_2196" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg" width="612" height="816" />
</a>

After dinner Hideki had to head up to the shop to prepare for a race in Tsukuba  in a couple days. On the way, we stopped off at a gift shop, and there was a group of these awesome Soarers chilling outside.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10933" alt="DSC_0025" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Back at Hachi Roku HQ, I started taking more pics. Even though this is my 3rd time, I still have an awesome time visiting there.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0028.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10936" alt="DSC_0028" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0028.jpg" width="474" height="313" />

</a>Yuya also gave me some....unusual chocolate. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2203.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10971" alt="IMG_2203" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2203.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

There's always interesting stuff laying around. Such as this cool 4AG Supercharger which I assume is off of an AW-11 motor.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10935" alt="DSC_0027" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg" width="474" height="313" />
</a>

Or these kouki lips
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2202.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10970" alt="IMG_2202" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2202.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

I also spotted this super old school Apexi AFC device. I forget what car it came off of, but apparently the thing still works from what Hideki tells me.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg">
</a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10969" alt="IMG_2201" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2201.jpg" width="612" height="816" />

</a>That same blue levin is still sitting there...hopefully somebody buys it eventually..;) haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10938" alt="DSC_0030" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0030.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

up above that is Hideki's dad's car, which is super clean<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10937" alt="DSC_0029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0029.jpg" width="474" height="313" />

</a>I was even surprised with the underbody.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0033.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10940" alt="DSC_0033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0033.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

He recently put a wing on his own 86 to get better downforce at Tsukuba. But, opposite to how I feel, his somewhat dislikes 86's with wings. So, after the tsukuba event, its coming off. haha
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10939" alt="DSC_0032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Towards the back there's a nice collection of exhausts hanging around.
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10941" alt="DSC_0034" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg" width="474" height="715" /></a>

Back towards the front you can see all the goodies lining the walls. I still wonder sometimes how the heck they got that red car in there. lol <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0026.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10934" alt="DSC_0026" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0026.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

The next morning we were heading off for Fuji Speedway to go watch Hideki's friend do some drifting! So, i'll cover that in a separate post!
