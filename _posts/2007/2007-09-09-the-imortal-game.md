[The Immortal Game](https://www.flickr.com/photos/34382263@N00/1347678449/), originally uploaded by [Virtual Traveler](https://www.flickr.com/people/34382263@N00/).


This is a photo of a painting I commissioned from [Blair Bradshaw](http://www.blairbradshaw.com/) last year. It shows the final crushing move of the [Immortal Game](http://www.virtualtravelog.net/2003/01/the-immortal-game-maybe-the-greatest-game-of-chess-ever-played/), circled in red. I chose Blair because I have a print of one of his other pieces and had been to his studio so was familiar with his style. I thought he would do a great job of the immortal game, which I had been thinking about getting painted for some time. The piece is 5ft square and is comprised of 64 small square mini-canvases. Blair and I spoke at length about how to visually show the history of the game. I think he did a great job and am very pleased with what I got.
