Hey everyone!

First off, i'd like to say Happy New Year, and hopefully this next one is better than the last for all of us.^_^ Hopefully everything had a good holidays/new year as well. With that said I'll make it a goal to be a bit more active around here this year. lol

Anyways, I recently had some upgrades on Yuki that I wanted to share and have just been super lazy in posting them. I had heard great things from friends about how much of a difference getting a corner balance on your car was. So, I decided to fork up the cash and try it out.

Luckily before doing so, Ken started talking to me and convinced me to get some new swift springs before going through with the corner balance. I was able to pick up a set for a great deal of $377 shipped for both sets from the guys over at <a href="http://shop.tougefactory.com/">Touge Factory</a> to replace the old crappy ones on my Megan Street series coilovers. Here's the 2 sets springs I ended up getting.

<strong>Front: 65MM(2.5") Inner Diameter, 8k(448lbs) Spring Rate, 178mm(7") Length</strong>

<strong>Rear: 65mm(2.5") Innder Diameter, 6k(336lbs) Spring Rate, 203mm(8") Length</strong>

<!--more-->

Here's a quick before shot when I got started replacing them.

Got the coil all dissassembled

Now, here's another piece that ken helped me out on. As you can see from the picture above, the collar that the spring rests on, has this stupid little plastic washer. Ken reccomended I change them out to some thrust bearings. This will enabled the coil to spin freely under compression. Since what you don't want is the spring to compress, then get binded on that plastic washer while still trying to compress.I was able to pick them up for $25 bucks a piece <a href="http://www.summitracing.com/parts/HAL-7888-109/">here</a> from Summit Racing and they're 65mm(2.5") for the inner diameter. 1 Quantity is basically 2 thrust bearings, and 4 washers. So you'd need one for each corner of the car.

Here's a quick shot of everything together in the front.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6384" title="swift_f2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f2.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>

You can really tell how much of a difference the thurst bearings make since the spring is able to freely spin now. It's also important to note where the perch was at before doing this. you don't want to have all this extra room or looseness at the top of the spring. lol

Here's a quick before shot of the rear

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6383" title="swift_r1" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r1.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>

and the after shot of the rear

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6382" title="swift_r2" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r2.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>

Here's a quick comparison of the two different srings. One big thing that stands out between the two is the number of coils, coil thickness and the weight of the coils. I took both of them down to the post office to get accurately weighed. I'll list the specs here below. One thing to note, is I found out oddly enough that I actually had S14 rear springs with my megan coilovers. So, my before spring length was 220mm so the weight was vastly heavier than the swifts. I'd assume though that if the spring was 200mm it would weigh at least 3lbs.

<strong>Front: Megans=2.88lbs(180mm), Swift=2.41lbs(180mm)</strong>

<strong>Rear: Megans=3.58(220mm), Swift=2.5(200mm)</strong>

Comparison for the front springs

Comparison of the rear springs.

Overall the feeling with these springs is a WORLD of difference. I'd highly reccomend them as an upgrade if you don't feel like shelling out 1.6k+ for upper teir coilovers. This hands down takes a set of budget coils and makes then a ton better.

You really notice it driving at around 35-45mph. The slight vibrations and small bumps are totally eliminated with the swift springs. I had my megan dampening set to 15 on both the front and rear when I tested this.

Okay, that was rather long winded. Now, moving onto the corner balance. I ended up getting mine done at a place locally here in seattle called <a href="http://www.trulineseattle.com/">Truline</a>. They had great customer service, guys who have experience in working with cars that have pillow ball suspension links, and aftermarket suspension. I also got my alignment, and wheel balancing done while I was there. For everything it ended up running me about $450 bucks. One cool feature they have is High-Speed balancing. It's basically where they balance the front wheels while they're still bolted to the car. I ended up doing this on the front of the car, and just a normal balance for the rear.

Moving onto the alignment, yet again Ken helped me out for which specs were optimal for the S13. After checking out the Nissan Road Race forum the specs I went with are below. The amount of camber you use is totally up to the wheel setup/personal preference really. When it was all said and done,

<strong>Front:</strong>
<strong> Toe: 0 Degrees</strong>
<strong> Caster: 7.5 Degrees</strong>
<strong> Camber: 3 Degrees</strong>

<strong>Rear</strong>
<strong> Toe: .2 Degrees</strong>
<strong> Camber: 2.5 Degrees</strong>

Going with the smaller wheel base and setting the caster to 7.5 degrees is a noticeable difference and makes the car alot more responsive and fun to drive!

Moving onto the corner balance, all I can say is WOW. They loaded the car with dead weight for the driver, and basically set the car to where weight is spread out evenly across all 4 wheels. This can change over time due to suspension, and things like the chassis flexing and bending over time(It is a 21 year old car).

In the corner the car feels alot more predicable and there's a TON more grip now then before. It's almost scary how much better the car feels now. For comparison, my buddy who owns a track prepped AE86 recently drove my car and commented on how it handled very similar in terms of response and stability while cornering.
