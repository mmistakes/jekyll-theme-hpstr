Hey All,

Sorry for the lack of posts. I actually had one last japan post to do here before getting into some other stuff. However, I recently started up school for the summer, got a new job, and had some other things that have taken up most of my time/focus.(Ken knows what i'm talking about) ;) haha Well, with that said, lets go back in time a little bit! haha

My second to last day here in japan is a pretty boring one. Today was mostly spent venturing around with not much to do, and finishing up on my blog stuff. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aIMG_0350.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8683" title="aIMG_0350" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/aIMG_0350-e1341096224945.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Found this really cool can of orange soda when I was at AGP over in the Fuji area. I was going to try and keep it, but broke down during lunch and decided to just drink it. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8686" title="DSC_0003" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0003.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After a quick lunch, I decided to take a stroll down the main road in Meguro to go check out the <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3028.html">Yebisu Garden Palance</a> that Ken had kept raving about. haha Along the way, I found a couple opportunity's to get some good shots.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8687" title="DSC_0006" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0006.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also managed to spot this cool 80's Mecedes. Although I'm not quite sure what model it was..Any guesses?

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8688" title="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0010.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

This really wierd looking building caught my eye. haha reminded me from something out of a Dr.Seuss book. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8689" title="DSC_0012" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0012.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I noticed closer I got, the ritzier and more fancy things were getting. Outside of one of the hotels was this nice waterfall thing.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8690" title="DSC_0013" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0013.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Sapporo Beer Station! this area was really cool and seemed to be like its own mini-town within tokyo. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8691" title="DSC_0014" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0014.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Panning over to the left more, there's a shot of the corridor that goes down some stairs and is lined with places to eat, and little shops. Everything was pretty expensive, so I decided to just look around instead of buying anything. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8693" title="DSC_0018" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0018.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Further ahead, there was this courtyard with a mansion behind it. I later realized this is actually a restaurant! 0_o Another thing I noticed, is alot of businessmen seemed to come here for lunch since it was overall really pretty and one of the few quiet places in the city to sit and enjoy your afternoon. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8694" title="DSC_0020" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0020.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another shot, this time looking backwards.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8695" title="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0022.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way back to my hotel I spotted this wierd looking building with a giant red ball stuck into the side. Now, most of you are probably wanting to know what it was. Same here, so I decided to go check it out!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0023.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8696" title="DSC_0023" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0023.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

yep, definitly wierd aright....HDS...? Maybe its some crazy building for a secret government orginization that fights with mechs!!???

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8697" title="DSC_0024" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0024.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

oh....it's just a driving school....OR IS IT!!??

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8698" title="DSC_0029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0029.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Managed to snap a picture of this R35 GTR after passing the driving school.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8699" title="DSC_0032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0032.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I got a bit of a laugh as I passed this Subaru Dealer on the way home. This Celica seemed completely out of place! Maybe it was trying to convince that BRZ to come over and be a Toyota. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0033.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8700" title="DSC_0033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0033.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Dealerships in general are SUPER small in japan compared to here in the US, where we have rows and rows of cars lined up outside. I bet your wondering where they're supposed to store all the new cars right? well...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0034.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8701" title="DSC_0034" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0034.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Mostly the same way they store bikes! racks on racks on racks! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0355.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8702" title="IMG_0355" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0355.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After getting back to the hotel, I was trying to figure out where I should eat at. I decided to try MosBurger since it was close-by. When I went in there, they had a picture of a normal cheeseburger. I could read the whole menu just fine without the pictures, but was feeling a bit lazy, so I just ordered that. Now, here's the wierd park. See that wierd "chili" like substance in my burger? THEY ALL COME WITH THAT. I don't quite get why since its not mentioned on the menu, but I guess its a mosburger special thing. Also, another thing I noticed is there's alot of places that have melon soda in japan, which tastes awesome. The Â burger on the other hand, was a bit crappy for the price I paid, but...it filled me up, so no complaints I guess.
<h4>Day 13</h4>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0356.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8703" title="IMG_0356" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0356.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

My last day in japan was pretty uneventful, but after checking out of my hotel, I went back over to my buddy Ken's place to hang out with him and his wife for a bit. After trying to think of something to do, we finally agreed on going to the movies, and getting some food, since my flight wasn't until later that night. Here I finally got a picture of the japanese movie theatre. The seats and inside overall is alot better kept, then the ones here in the US. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0358.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8705" title="IMG_0358" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0358-e1341097533193.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

They had this cool Doraemon popcorn box for kids. I was almost tempted to buy one just for the hell of it. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0359.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8706" title="IMG_0359" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0359.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Afterwards we went to another burger joint called Freshness Burger that Ken and his wife assured me I wouldn't be disappointed. Sure enough, I wasn't, and while the burger seemed a bit small, it was pretty loaded.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0360.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8707" title="IMG_0360" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0360-e1341097623652.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

The price was a bit steep though comapred to here in the US for a burger. It was 1,132Yen which works out to being about $14USD. Get used to this when in Tokyo though, because this is a pretty average price here. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0361.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8708" title="IMG_0361" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0361-e1341097784846.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

This place had a cool sign with Do As Infinity's signature on it! ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0362.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8709" title="IMG_0362" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0362-e1341097819249.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

We ended up finding a store that was very similar to Spencer's here in the US, and they had some wierd stuff. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0363.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8710" title="IMG_0363" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0363.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Yeah.......basically a giant poo hat. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0365.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8711" title="IMG_0365" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0365-e1341097971300.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Here's a sign for a store that sold a bunch of Ultimate Muscle stuff. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0366.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8712" title="IMG_0366" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0366-e1341098009734.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Oh yeah, manequinns in japan are wayyy cooler than the boring ones we have in the US. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0367.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8713" title="IMG_0367" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0367-e1341098354480.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Well, that's about it from my trip! Here's a quick shot of me in LA for my layover on the way to Seattle. Overall I'm really glad I was able to take this trip, meet and hangout with everybody over there, and I had a blast! I'm for sure going to come back again to japan sometime next year!
