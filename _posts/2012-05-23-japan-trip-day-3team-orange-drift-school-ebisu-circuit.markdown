For Day 3 of my trip, Luckily I was able to save up some money, and also get some help to attend the Team Orange Drift School at Ebisu Circuit!

Eichi and I got up around 4am, and headed out to Fukushima prefecture around 5. Naturally, with a car like his, you don't want door dings, so you make sure nobody parks next to you. :p

This 7-11 is within walking distance from the Apartment. So, we stopped in to grab a few things before hitting the road for the 3hour road trek up north.

Breakfast consisted of Milk Tea made by Kirin of all companies. haha I thought they only made beer..*shrugs*. I also had gotten some Tamago Pan(Egg bun), but had eaten both of them before realizing I Should've taken a picture. So, next time I'll make sure to do so.

There were alot of tunnels along the way, some of which went on for a solid 2,000meters

here's a shot from inside the tunnel

There was some really nice scenery out here, and personally I like it a bit more out in the country compared to the city in Tokyo. lol

We tried to catch up to this S15, which looked really nice, but the guy was going pretty deng fast. lol

A few more cars spotted on the highway. This time it was a R33 and a 180sx.

Really pretty road leading into Ebisu Circuit

AT LAST! Ebisu!!

We arrived a bit early, so I walked around and did some exploring. Here's is a picture of the Drift School Couse, with the Touge course above it, and the Higashi(East) course to the right behind it. The Higashi course is mainly used for grip driving and is featured in Best Motoring and Hot Version.

After a little bit, we met up with Andy from Powervehicles.com and Naoto Suenaga From Team Orange. For those that don't know, both of these guys are profressional drifters and know what they're doing. This would be my weapon of choice for the day. a Nissan Silvia with .9bar(12 psi) of boost. in this pic, they were trying to fix an issue with the tire stem, since it was leaking air slowly.

This car also had drift essentials like steering wheel, aftermarket gauges, bucket seat, coilovers,exhaust and an LSD.

After a few quick pointers, they had me do doughnuts around those stacked cones. Doing left turn doughnuts was no problem, but right side ones was a completely different story. After some struggling with it, I finally was able to do it consistently both directions.

Sadly, there's no pics of the rest of my skid-pad sessions, but I'll just break down what happened anyways. After doing doughnuts, they started me for doing e-brake entry into doughnuts around some cones. Once again, left handers were no problem. But, the right handers proved to be an issue. Than, to add fuel to the fire, it started to rain and I had to learn on the fly how to drift in the wet vs. dry. Having done neither before, this step was the most challenging I think. After a while I finally got the techniue down, and we moved on to doing figure eights. These went pretty well, and got a couple more advnaced techniques taught since I was progressing so well throughout the morning.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00531.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7331" title="DSC_0053" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00531.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After a while we decided to break for lunch, then afterwards it would be time to hitup the Drift Land Course. We went up to this resterraunt that was located at the top of the circuit.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7330" title="DSC_0051" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00511.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The inside was really nice, and they had all different kinds of food, ice cream, and other misc things in there.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00491.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7329" title="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00491.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I ordered up some Miso Chyashu(pork) Ramen. It was very, VERY good, and the best ramen i've ever had. However, I could barely eat any of it sadly :( This was because I get motion sickness pretty easy. Read books in the car, riding on planes, and yes...drifting. When I'm driving its not quite as bad as when I ride shotgun, but after about 4 hours of driving it was starting to take its toll.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7334" title="DSC_0056" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00561.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After barely touching my lunch, we went down to the PowerVehicles.com shop/area to see all the cool drift missiles and cars that were sitting around.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01141.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7373" title="DSC_0114" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01141.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I don't have any pics of my driving the Drift Land Course, but there's video footage at the bottom of the post. However, I did manage to get some tandem action in with Suenaga-san himself! lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0163.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7375" title="DSC_0163" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0163.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once we wrapped up for the day, Suenaga-san gave me a t-shirt as a gift, as well as a ride-along in his personal S14 on the Touge Course. All I have to say, is damn.....there's a reason why this guy is a pro. The things had does while in that car is unbelievable.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0115.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7374" title="DSC_0115" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0115.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Big thanks and shout out to Suenaga-san, and the rest of Team Orange as well as Andy and Emily from <a href="http://powervehicles.com">Powervehicles.com</a>! Both of them made this a great experience and if you have a little bit of extra money, I highly reccomend going out to do this! It costed me aout $1,000USD and that covered the car, and full tank of gas, and a set of spare tires(that I never used due to the rain).

We stopped along the way back to Gunma to get some gas at Eneos!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0219.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7380" title="DSC_0219" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0219.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

while getting gas we ran into this awesome Datsun Bluebird. Sadly, the owner was nowhere to be found. :(

Last stop for the day was at the Super Autobacs store in Maebashi.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0250.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7402" title="DSC_0250" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0250.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way into the parking lot, we spotted this S15 tucked away on the side. I'm not sure what's up with people and those ugly chrome tails though. &gt;_&lt;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7388" title="DSC_0232" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0232.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This autobacs had some cool stuff, including a bunch of Drift Tengoku and SuperGT DVD's.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0235.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7390" title="DSC_0235" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0235.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They also had all other kinds of goodies there. There's more pics of stuff in the gallery below. ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0259.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7405" title="DSC_0259" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0259.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This is the price you pay for drifting 4 hours straight, before finally remembering you brought gloves...T_T After a long, tiring and painful day of drifting I was ready to get some sleep, and rest. I was already pretty sore from driving all day.

The next day is going to involve packing up to head back to Tokyo, and sifting through all the footage/pics I took. lol

Here's some video footage of the Drift School!
