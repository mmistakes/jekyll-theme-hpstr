First one is actually from back before I left on my japan trip. lol My buddy Ricky(white shirt) and John(black shirt) went to grab food at the mall nearby. When we came out this Supra happened to be sitting next to my car. we were pretty blown away when this chick started walking towards is, and unlocks the car. We stood and chatted with her for a bit, but sadly the car was an auto...:(

I recently got a new job since coming back from japan, and one thing I did understimate was how expensive parking was downtown! &gt;_&lt; My old job paid for parking, so I never had to worry about it. I finally found a couple good spots that have parking for alot cheaper if you get there before 9am. I work at 6, so this isn't a problem for me. haha Here's one that was on the rooftop, so I thought it was a good time to snap a quick picture. haha
