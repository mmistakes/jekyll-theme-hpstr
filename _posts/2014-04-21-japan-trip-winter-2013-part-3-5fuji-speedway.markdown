So, while I was in Shizuoka, Hideki invited me out to a drift day happening over at Fuji Speedway. He wasn't driving since he had an event at Tsukuba the following day, but one of his friends was. So, I tagged along for a ride.<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0082.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0082" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0082.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

The morning started off pretty early with Hideki stopping by the hotel to come pick me up.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2204.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10998" alt="IMG_2204" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2204.jpg" width="816" height="612" />
</a>

After that it was off to grab some food before heading up to Fuji Speedway. This place called Smile(スマイル) apparently is pretty famous, and is only found here in shizuoka. You can get Udon, Onigiri and Coffee for only ￥３００($3.00USD)! <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10996" alt="IMG_2207" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2207.jpg" width="612" height="816" />

After breakfast it was off to Fuji!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg"><img alt="IMG_2208" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

When we first got there, I was pretty surprised at just how many 4-doors there were. Apparently this trend has been getting popular lately in Japan, but since our 4door cars in the US are crap, its not quite the go-to option for drifting.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11035" alt="DSC_0037" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg" width="474" height="313" />
</a>

More chaser goodness<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11029" alt="DSC_0044" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

A bit farther down, this pinked out s14 was driven by a girl of course. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11025" alt="DSC_0048" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

We later caught up with Hideki's friend Kodai driving this white AE86. I'll post video I took down towards the bottom of the page.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0042.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11031" alt="DSC_0042" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0042.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2209.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10994" alt="IMG_2209" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2209.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Also another one of their friends was driving this blue silvia.<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0043.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11030" alt="DSC_0043" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0043.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10992" alt="IMG_2211" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2211.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

This 86 was also killing it all day which I later found out was one of the Run-Free guys!<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0058.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0058" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0058.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11021" alt="DSC_0052" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0052.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

After the morning session, we headed over back towards the main circuit area to get some food. Kodai looks indecisive since pretty much everything at these little shacks tastes awesome and its not very expensive either! I ended up eating a crepe and some curry rice. To everyone's surprise, the crepe was first. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10990" alt="IMG_2214" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

Hideki couldn't resist taking some shots to post up over on his <a href="http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/" target="_blank">Minkara Blog</a>.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10989" alt="IMG_2215" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Talk about having a professional cameraman pose! :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11009" alt="DSC_0068" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

I decided it was my turn to try taking some fancy pictures. I think they came out looking okay.<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11014" alt="DSC_0061" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0061.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0062.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11013" alt="DSC_0062" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0062.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0063.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11012" alt="DSC_0063" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0063.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0064.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11011" alt="DSC_0064" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0064.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

After lunch it was back to the pit area to do some more scouting.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0049.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11024" alt="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0049.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Hideki later intoduced me to the guy putting on the event for day, Koichi Urushibara. he's was super nice and we talked about all sorts of things about the US and Japan. When I told him, he could easily sell that car for around 12k in the US, he was pretty surprised. haha His car was running great, and I got quite a surprise when he popped the hood...<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0045.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11028" alt="DSC_0045" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0045.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Vmount, and lots of other goodies that I don't see most SR's in japan with! I wish my engine bay was this clean. T_T <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2218.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10988" alt="IMG_2218" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2218.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

You can actually catch more info of his car featured in the Febuary issue of Drift Tengoku!<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1654122_10202764939112040_1560005636_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11037" alt="1654122_10202764939112040_1560005636_n" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1654122_10202764939112040_1560005636_n.jpg" width="720" height="960" /></a>

Once things started wrapping up for the day, shenanigans ensued. Talk about Inception setting in. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0077.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11003" alt="DSC_0077" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0077.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

A little prior to this, Yuya and his wife had came up from Shizuoka to watch, and also give me a ride back to shizuoka! haha<a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_22201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11041" alt="IMG_2220" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_22201.jpg" width="474" height="632" /></a>

I was able to snap a proper group shot finally. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0074.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11005" alt="DSC_0074" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0074.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

This guy threw a peace sign for the camera as he was leaving, but I fail and missed it..&gt;&lt;<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0081.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11001" alt="DSC_0081" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0081.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

Fuji Speedway is always tons of fun and I can't wait to go back! Since Hideki was off to Tsukuba after this, we all headed out to get dinner before parting.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0083.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10999" alt="DSC_0083" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0083.jpg" width="474" height="313" /></a>

We went to this Family Resteraunt called COCO's. Overall the food was great.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2223.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11040" alt="IMG_2223" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2223.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Although the portion size on this spaghetting left alot of be desired..:(<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11038" alt="IMG_2221" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2221.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Luckily this pizza was really good! haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2222.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11039" alt="IMG_2222" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2222.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Overall even though I didn't drive it was great to watch and interact with everyone there. The next day, I left Shizuoka and headed for Osaka to hangout with friends down in the Kansai area! I'll be covering that in the next post, so stay tuned!
