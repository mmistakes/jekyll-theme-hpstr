What they say about Open Source Projects are true, It's a vast ocean, full of projects of different shapes and sizes. It is definitely hard finding a good project. Either the project is inactive or else the project is "too much" for you else its documentation is like reading chinese and the people there don't even care of your existence since you're not a pro. Since my voyage into OSS started, I have bumped into a lot of projects, but after a long search a certain one caught my attention. Zulip; its a chat bot for organizations and people to work together sharing ideas and opinions. Much like a group chat, it has realms which are completely isolated from one another, which are basically different instance of the application running independendly. Within each realms there are chats which are divided by topics known as "Streams". So thats zulip summarized for you. So what made me stick to zulip is that their community is very very active, they have a beautifully written documentation and they IRC is basically another Realm in zulip, plus their community is super friendly and welcoming towards newcomers. 

I discovered zulip about three weeks ago, and this being my first OSS, boy, I admit it is pretty darn difficult to get started. But they have put as much of work in maintaining their documentation as they have done in building zulip. So I started reading through their documentation doing small tests and getting familiarised with the codebase. Since I'd like to think myself as a ameteur Django'ist and also since they need some more coverage on their Django tests, I think with a little bit of polishing I'd be of their assistance.

So to start working on the main tests, I'd have to start small. I started looking into implementing Integrations in zulip and slowly getting into their tests. So that in time I may do testing for the main database.
