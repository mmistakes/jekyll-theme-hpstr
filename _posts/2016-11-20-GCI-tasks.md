## TASK 1 - Test integration with Slack


### The integration specified on the GCI tasks page.

* HelloSign : Callback provided. Need to provide credit card information to login. Easy enough. 	[https://www.hellosign.com/api/eventsAndCallbacksWalkthrough](https://www.hellosign.com/api/eventsAndCallbacksWalkthrough)
* Mention : Good and detailed documentation 	[https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/#payload-url](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/#payload-url) [https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/)
* appfollow : I couldn't find the documentation for integrating with third party applications nor the callback URL. Seems like this one is solely dedicated to Slack.

### The rest of the integrations on slack.
Okay the first things I noticed while searching for probable zulip integrations on slack are the lack of third party integration tutorials. Most of them are just integrations to Slack and there is no proper documentation, for obtaining the payload the API section is nowhere to be found. The most common thing I found while looking for Integrations on slack are : Want to add your own integration? Contact Us.
