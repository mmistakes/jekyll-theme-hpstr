Oh my god, what a hectic three days this was. Practice, Practicals and Coding. Finally I've managed to get this blog running even if it meant losing few nights of sleep and losing my one and only github ID. I don't know why I was this adament on using a website hosted on github and moreover written using markdown. Seeing the simplicty of markdown and the elegance, It was kinda worth it. I found Jekyll to be easy but I managed to screwed up big time and now Hugo came in to save me and guess I'll stick with this. 

Uggh. No.

The problem was actually with the browser serving me the wrong DNS. Not anything to with the site itself. It was resolved when I used incognito. Oh, what I'd do without you incongnito! Well, we're back using Jekyll.

Cheers. :D
