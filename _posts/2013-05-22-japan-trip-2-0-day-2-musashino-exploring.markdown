Hello again! A bit late on getting these up since I've been pretty busy as its day #5 right now as I write this. haha Anywho, on Day 2 I was pretty tired from the trip up to tsukuba, and the jetlag so I just decided to stick close to my friend's house and do some exploring.

I started off tinkering with some of the filters on my camera, since I had never really used them. haha I really liked this sepia toned one since it fits with the rust shack and old school style gas pump. :p

I noticed they had this cool hill for practicing skii-ing and snowboarding on. It kind of reminded me of that korean movie Take Off.

I'm not sure why, but I found this tree thingy interesting....so I took a picture. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9425" alt="DSC_0011" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00111.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One of the main pathways when you first enter the park. I was surprised at how huge this place was. I only made it about halfway through before it started to rain pretty hard.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00051.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9421" alt="DSC_0005" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00051.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After getting out of the park, I stumped across these cool looking shrine

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0020.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9431" alt="DSC_0020" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0020.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing that kind of throws me off, is where the sidewalk will randomly end, and you need to change sides of the road. Luckily, it didn't end, but instead turned into this long corridor of greens, and puddles. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00231.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9432" alt="DSC_0023" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00231.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Since it was raining pretty hard, and I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I decided to finally try some ramen here in japan. Amazingly enough, it was my first time having regular type ramen.(last time I had tsukemen)

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00192.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9430" alt="DSC_0019" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00192.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

I walked in and was greeted by these 2 old ladies, who were pretty surprised to be seeing a foreigner just randomly pop up at their little hole-in-the-wall ramen shop. Luckily they seemed a bit more reassured once they realized I could speak japanese. lol

I ended up ordering some Miso Chashu, which was really good. The only different I noticed compared to the ones I've had in Seattle is this one was a bit more saltier than I was used to. Overall it was great, and was a decent price at $7.

After getting lunch, I ran into these pair of awesome mini-looking advans! haha

Turns out they were from this VIP shop called Supirior

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1179.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9435" alt="IMG_1179" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1179-e1369284234198.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Also spotted this not-so-good looking Honda accord. Reminds me of ones in the US. lol

Last stop for the day was the video/game store to check out any goodies they might have. I noticed they had this movie which Derrick has been searching for recently. So, before I leave this area, I'll have to pick it up.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1185.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9439" alt="IMG_1185" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1185-e1369284527959.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I think its cool how alot of japanese shops are super tiny, but they're still able to get work done.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1187.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9440" alt="IMG_1187" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1187-e1369284553598.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Along the way back I also spotted this super clean looking VIP Toyota Celsior!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1190.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9441" alt="IMG_1190" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1190-e1369284628711.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Also, while this Subaru wasn't realy anything special, I thought it was pretty nice looking.

Just another quick shot of some random car shop. Its interesting to see they work on lots of different types of cars here. Taxi's, mercedes, and kei cars.
