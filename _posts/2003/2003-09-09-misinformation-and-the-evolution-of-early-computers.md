Amazing and totally inaccurate!

It’s difficult to know where to start in cataloging the faults with this diagram. So rather than waste my time trying I’ve started collating information to produce a better version. I’ll publish it here when I’m done.

I’m not sure where this diagram came from. It could be “Computer Structures” by Gordon Bell. But the reference was unclear.
