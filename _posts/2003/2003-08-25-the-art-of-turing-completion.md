As I was researching the [invention of the computer](/2003/08/the-first-modern-computer-the-case-for-baby-the-manchester-mk-i-prototype/) I found a few sites that while only tangentially related to the subject at hand were definitely worthy of note.


## XSLT is Turing Complete

[Unidex](http://www.unidex.com/) a B2B integration solutions provider developed a [Turing Machine Markup Language](http://www.unidex.com/turing/tmml.dtd.htm) and a complementary [XSLT Universal Turing Machine](http://www.unidex.com/turing/utm.xsl.htm). An example table of rules is available for the XSLT machine that implements the [ROT13 cipher](http://www.unidex.com/turing/rot13_tm.xml.htm). So we can all sleep easy knowing that XSLT is Turing Complete.

## The Game of Life is Turing Complete

Like Alan Turing, John Conway was a Cambridge Mathematician. He invented a mathematical game called the [Game of Life](http://www.cpdee.ufmg.br/~seixas/PaginaATR/Download/DownloadFiles/MathematicalGames.pdf),. So I guess it is in some way fitting that someone would try to implement a [Turing Machine in the Game of Life](http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm). Paul Rendell has succeeded. I still can’t quite come to terms with this! What does it mean ?

## Turing Machines as Art

The Manchester [Illuminated Universal Turing Machine](http://www.verostko.com/manchester/manchester.html) project was completed by the Algorithmic Artist [Roman Verostko](http://www.verostko.com/). In 1998 Verostko took the binary representation of a Universal Turing Machine and used it as input for a pen plotter.

Konrad Zuse’s early computing machines have been shown to be Turing Complete., at least theoretically. [This installation](http://www.videokasbah.net/zuse2.html) explores Zues’s choice of discarded 35mm film and the unintended marriage of image and raw code that this produced. And here is a page dedicated to [Konrad Zuse’s own art](http://www.rtd-net.de/Zusepictures.html).
