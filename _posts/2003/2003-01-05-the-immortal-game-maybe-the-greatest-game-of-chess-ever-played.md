In July 1851 two mathematics teachers, Prof. Adolf Anderssen (1818 -1879) from Breslau, and Lionel Kieseritzky (1806-1853)  from what is now Estonia, played a game of chess at Simpsons on the Strand, a London chess Salon. The game was so startling in its brlliance that in 1855 it was named The Immortal Game by the Austrian player Ernst Falkbeer. The chess Canon contains very few named games. This game is considered by some to be the greatest ever played. It has been been studied and replayed for over 150 years.

The applet used to display this game is called [PGN Viewer](http://chesstempo.com/pgn-usage.html) and can be used to display any chess game or fragment of a game. It is freely available from Chess Tempo. A [Portable Game Notation (PGN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) file with my annotation of this game is [here](/content/2003/Imortal_Game.pgn). PGN is a nicely specified notation that allows the storage and transfer of annotated chess games. Most serious chess software allows for import and export of PGN games.
