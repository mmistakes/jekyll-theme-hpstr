This is the first map of The Internet. It shows the first node on the ARPANET at the University California Los Angeles (UCLA) on the 2nd September 1969. The diagram is taken from [Casting the Net: From ARPANET to INTERNET and beyond](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201876744/virtualtravel-20) by Peter H. Salus and was drawn by [Alex McKinzie who worked for BBN](http://special.lib.umn.edu/findaid/xml/cbi00123.xml). Any Travelog needs maps.
