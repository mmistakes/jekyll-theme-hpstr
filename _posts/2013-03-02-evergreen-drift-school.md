When I initially built my s13(Yuki), I decided I wasn't going to be doing that many track days in an effort to keep her clean and unmolested by unsuspecting corners, cones, and whatever else jumps out at you on circuits.

Well....that didn't last very long. After driving at Ebisu Circuit for the [Team Orange Drift School](http://domofactor.com/japan-trip-day-3team-orange-drift-school-ebisu-circuit/) back in 2012, I decided it was time to get out there to get some more seat time.

Luckily, around early 2013 [Evergreen Drift](http://evergreendrift.com) was putting on a drift school event, which seemed like a great way to get more seat time and have a blast. So I threw some tires on my spare s14 wheels and made the 20 minute trip over to [Evergreen Speedway](http://evergreenspeedway.com) from Mukilteo,WA.

Once I got there and got all setup, I got assigned my instructor for the day. Which, funny enough ended up being my buddy Gaelen Norman over at [BigBoy Media](http://bigboymedia.net).

After being dubbed "The E-Brake Master" from repeated and uneccesary use of it during my skidpad sessions, it was time to hit the 3/8's course.

One thing that surprised me is how different it was compared to my first time back at Ebisu Circuit. The tight and technical stuff vs. higher speed sweeper really through me for a loop. Luckily, Gaelen was great at giving me some helpful tips and a bit of crap for spinning out a bunch. :p

Here's one of my more better looking runs.

Overall I got a great taste of driving at Evergreen and seeing how my s13 drove compared to the SR powered one I used at Ebisu Circuit.
