"what's that? I have a blog? really!?"

Sometimes I have those kind of conversations with myself. I keep getting these busy periods, and forget to upload stuff here. :p haha hopefully I can start getting stuff up in a more consistent manner.

Anywho, for those that don't know, once a year during spring there's a tradition in japan called 花見(Hanami). It basically involves relaxing under sakura trees, hanging out with friends, and enjoying some food and drinks. Also, somewhat a yearly tradition, is people taking pictures of their cars during this time with sakura trees in the background. :p

<!--more-->The funny thing about this place is I was actually searching for a good spot to do the photoshoot, and didn't really find anything. Then, just as I was driving home, I spotted this little place that I never noticed for some reason before! lol

I never noticed, but this picture actually has two different light contrasts to it, which seems cool. The left side, has the bare tree and darker shade on the car. While the right side has bloomed sakura, and a lighter shade. Anybody care to do some AfterEffects magic to make that stand out more? *cough* Darrick. :p

One thing I keep realizing evertime I take pictures of my car....is that I need to put my type-x lip on....badly. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9217" alt="DSC_0015" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0015.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I still have a hard time believing that this is my car sometimes. Nissan did such an awesome job with the kouki aero in 97-98.
