Okay, so it took me a couple days to get this one uploaded just because I was so busy while I was in Gunma. haha A full gallery of all of my pictures can be seen at the bottom of the post after the jump!

Day 2 of my trip started early. Having to meet my friend Eichi up at the Shin-Maebashi station in Gunma around 10am required me to getup around 5am, and get on the train by 6 to beat the morning rush.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0233.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7267" title="IMG_0233" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0233-e1337765200480.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Spotted this AKB48 store while at the station in Harajuku. Funny story actually as to why I had to stop there instead of continuing on towards gunma....

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7273" title="IMG_0239" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239-e1337766525922.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I forgot this little guy. My present for Eichi which was smoked salmon. haha It didn't hit me until I had gotten to the Harajuku station, so I had to get off the train, and go back for it. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7280" title="gunma_train_route" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png" alt="" width="620" height="319" /></a>

After that, more chaos ensued at Omiya station north of tokyo.(top middle in the image) I had a little bit of trouble trying to figure out which train I needed to take because the line for Orange colored trains went into two opposite directions. My final destination was Shim-Maebashi station. After missing the first train in the proper direction, I figured out what was going on, and managed to get on the right one. I'll post about my route below:

JR Yamanote Line(Light Green): Meguro -&gt; Ikebukuro

JR Saikyo Line(Turqoise): Ikebukuro -&gt; Omiya

JR Takasaki Line (Orange): Omiya -&gt; Takasaki

JR Takasaki Line (Orange): Takaksaki-&gt; Shim-Maebashi

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7274" title="IMG_0240" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After arriving in Maebashi, Eichi was waiting for me with his blue Mazda RX-7(FD3s). This is his personal car, and also doubles as a shop car featuring all parts from his shop <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CompleteGarage.ReSanai">Complete Garage Re-Sanai</a>.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7130" title="DSC_0001" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

First task of the day was to head over to the shop, and check out all the awesome rotary goodness.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7141" title="DSC_0014" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Inside the shop I was greeted with a surprise! Their Time Attack car driven at Tsukuba Circuit by none other than Tarzan Yamada himself. If I remember correctly, Eichi said it did a time of 58 seconds and had about 600hp.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7167" title="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

After a bit of shooting, we grabbed some drinks from this cool shop owned vending machine. It seems to not like foreigners though since we put in 150Yen($1 USD), and instead of giving a lemon drink, it gave us Mello Yello which was about 30yen cheaper.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7169" title="DSC_0051" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Wondering why it decided to steal money, Eichi called up the Vendor to get them to come out and fix it.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7148" title="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While waiting for the maintenance guy to show up, I went and took a few more shots

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7181" title="DSC_0068" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After about 10-15 minute, this guy showed up to fix the machine, and give us our money back. Which I thought was really nice.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7188" title="DSC_0080" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After closing up the shop, we headed over to meetup with Eichi's friend Terushige(Teru for short). At that same time, the handle seemed to had broken on the FD..:( and his window also doesn't work, so he can't jump in Nascar style either.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7187" title="DSC_0079" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Luckily, Teru had some tools stashed away in his Curren and helped fix the cable in the FD's door. It's also worth noting that the Curren has the same platform as the GT-Four Celica, except its FF, and has a slightly different look to it.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7200" title="DSC_0094" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After fixing the door issue, we headed over to a Pudding/Dessert Cafe called <a href="http://www.crayon2007.com/index.htm">Crayon</a>. Apparently I was the first foreigner ever to set foot in the place, which was kind of cool. haha Eichi then introduced me to the owner Okada-san, and said he also drove a RX-7. Interested I asked "what does it look like." well, a short walk around the side of the shop answered that question.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7204" title="DSC_0102" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The person in black in the background is Okada-san, and this is his 800hp touge attacking machine. When I asked him if he drives this at the circuit, he simple replied "no, only on the touge."..0_o

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7202" title="DSC_0099" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were two things that really stood out to me about this car(other than the 800hp). This awesome Carbon Drag style wing was one of them

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7205" title="DSC_0105" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The second thing, was this GIGANTIC turbo. haha that pretty much explained the 800hp. The inlet on that thing was bigger than my entire fist!!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7210" title="DSC_0112" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Okada-san had one last surprise for us before we left. A Shiny new 2011 Nissan GTR! ^_^ While it was stock, it still looked super nice. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7276" title="IMG_0242" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242-e1337769730460.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7277" title="IMG_0243" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

After the meeting Okada-san and his awesome cars, we got some lunch. I had Katsudon with some cold soba noodles and dipping sauce which was actually alot of food for only 880Yen!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7214" title="DSC_0117" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After lunch Eichi and I headed up to the legendary Mt.Haruna(Akina) which was roughly 30 minutes away. It looks EXACTLY like is does in the anime, even the water tower behind us is the same. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7222" title="DSC_0127" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I took a couple more fancy pics of the rx-7, before heading to another familiar place....

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7236" title="DSC_0141" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Yup, that's right. Lake Haruna(Akina)!! ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7239" title="DSC_0144" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

The Lighting here was really odd because it would go from light to dark every couple minutes. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7252" title="DSC_0170" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

As we were leaving I took a couple more pictures, and its sort of hard to see here, but there were black doughnut circles all over the place from people coming here at night and playing around drifting and doing doughnuts. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7262" title="DSC_0189" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Later that night, after we got back to Eichi's place, Teru-san stopped by with a surprise, His Rx-7! this one, like eichi's was running a 13BT, and had about 1.4bar(17 psi) of boost making about 400hp.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7279" title="IMG_0246" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246-e1337770848178.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

As we were sitting at Eichi's place talking with Taru, he got a message from his friend that she was making Korean food and hanging out with some of his other friends and girlfriend, and invited us to come try some. So we headed over to a bar/lounge called Clover that one of the friends owns. After talking to them, they were all really nice, and surprised I came to Gunma all the way from Seattle. oh and also that I spoke japanese. haha The food above is Called bibimbap, and it was rice with hamburger, egg, onions, and some other misc stuff. It was really good, and I actually couldn't eat all of it, since I was still full from having a late lunch.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7278" title="IMG_0245" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

They also had a Super Famicom there as well, with a bunch of games including Rockman. lol After eating and talking for a bit, we realized it was already 11pm. Since we had to getup around 4am to get started on going to ebisu circuit in the morning. We decided to call it a night, and get some sleep.
