Day 14 was my last day in Tokyo and man was it ever a long one. Check out everything after the jump!

The day started off pretty well, spotting this clean blacked out R35!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13621.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10320" alt="IMG_1362" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13621.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

First stop of the day was to get lunch with my friend Miki for some Mexican Food. It was actually pretty nice weather out, but my phone was being wierd. So, some of these pics are foggy. :(
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13641.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1364" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13641.jpg" width="620" height="465" />
</a><a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13651.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10323" alt="IMG_1365" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13651.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13631.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10321" alt="IMG_1363" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13631.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

The burrito was actually really good, and tasted like a regular mexican food over in seattle<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10324" alt="IMG_1366" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13661.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After lunch, I headed over to Shibuya to do some shopping for friends<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10300" alt="IMG_1368" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1368.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

As usual, it was pretty crowded, but....<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1369.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10301" alt="IMG_1369" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1369.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

There was this random looking Rolls Royce chillin on the side of the street.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1370.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10302" alt="IMG_1370" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1370.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

While in shibuya, I also got a quick glance of this really clean S15!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1371.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10303" alt="IMG_1371" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1371.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Next stop was to head over to Tokyo station to pickup some gifts from Tokyo Bannana, and to checkout a couple interesting stores I heard about..<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13721.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10329" alt="IMG_1372" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13721.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Yep, the Tomica store! This is the same one featured in the Speedhunters article <a href="http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/05/chocolate-nissans-more-japan-hobbyhunting/" target="_blank">here</a>. Sadly, there wasn't really very many interesting things this time..:\<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10306" alt="IMG_1373" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

I then took the train over a few stops to Akihabara to go check out Yodabashi Camera to see what other goodies they have. It's a bit wierd having big stores like this be on 8 or 9 Floors, instead of one or 2 huge ones like in the US. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10307" alt="IMG_1374" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

This time, there were plenty of interesting Tomika models to drool over!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10308" alt="IMG_1375" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

for example, they even had ones like this Toyota 86(Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10333" alt="IMG_1376" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

I then made my way over to the Hobby section, and was blown away how many awesome models they had!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10310" alt="IMG_1378" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Some of you might have noticed this awesome Senna model. I was really close to buying it, but it was a bit pricey at 54 bucks. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10313" alt="IMG_1381" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Moving down the line they had some other awesome cars like this R31 with...Michael Bay explosions..? and a sweet N2 Toyota AE86.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10311" alt="IMG_1379" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Naturally, they also had some Itasha models as well!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10314" alt="IMG_1382" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

They also had some more expensive Die Cast models, but these were even more expensive ranging from $50-$500! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10312" alt="IMG_1380" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Another thing I wanted to snap a quick picture of, is in japan, they use booth babes for EVERYTHING. It's kind of awesome. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1383.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10315" alt="IMG_1383" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1383.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

After doing some shopping, I had some time to kill before more Shenanigans that were going to take place that day. This Tropicana grapefruit soda was AMAZING! <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1384.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10316" alt="IMG_1384" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1384.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

My friend Kensaku(ken) was nice enough to drive all the way out to Meguro from Kakegawa to hang out! <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10160" alt="DSC_0124" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01241.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We went to find a parking spot nearby, and went to get some food since he hadn't eaten dinner yet.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01261.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10161" alt="DSC_0126" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01261.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We ended up going into this place that had AMAZING tonkatsu. <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01271.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10162" alt="DSC_0127" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01271.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I had the Black Pepper, and Garlic pieces, which I would later regret....alot...
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1387.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10319" alt="IMG_1387" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1387.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

Also, the rice came in these cool wooden containers!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1386.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10318" alt="IMG_1386" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1386.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tonkatsu.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10226" alt="tonkatsu" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tonkatsu.jpg" width="720" height="540" /></a>

After getting food, we decided to hitup the Roppongi area since I didn't quite get time to go over there yet. While driving around this Ferrari 458 Italia was spotted!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10163" alt="DSC_0130" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I kinda found this bumper sticker funny, and this sort of thing is rare in japan on regular cars. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10164" alt="DSC_0131" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another shot of downtown Roppongi<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10165" alt="DSC_0132" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its hard to believe that this girl actually had the same pace as us throughout the city for about 10-15 minutes. We kept getting stuck at red lights, and she would catch up to us on her bike. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10166" alt="DSC_0133" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I felt like I was back in California for a second when I spotted this old school lowrider with underglow!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10167" alt="DSC_0135" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We then went over to cruise through the red light district, when we spotted one of his friend's cars. Apparently he likes to go there pretty often. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10168" alt="DSC_0136" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We made a short pitstop somewhere in tokyo(I forget the name), so Ken could pickup some contract thing from one of his co-workers.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10169" alt="DSC_0139" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While the contract exchange was going on, this pretty clean Mark II Chaser with BBS wheels pulled out from the alley infront of us. haha Its such a shame we don't have awesome 2JZ 4-door cars in the US..:(<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10170" alt="DSC_0140" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

By this time it was already around 1am, but I kind of wanted to go back to check out Daikokufuto again. So, we hopped in the Kei car beast, got on the legendary C1 Loop to do some late night wangan runs!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10171" alt="DSC_0143" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I'm still blown away at how smooth these roads are even after 20+ years of people racing on them. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10173" alt="DSC_0146" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Those of you who have plated Tokyo Extreme Racer, or other japanese racing games know how annoying, but also useful these lane seperators can be. Its worth noting shoving another car into these in real life at 300km/h is probably not a very good idea. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10175" alt="DSC_0151" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

hmm...stay on the C1 loop, or hitup the legendary Wangan/BayShore route...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10178" alt="DSC_0156" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to hop off the C1, and head towards Daikoku. Along the way, we ran into this super popular tunnel that's been featured many times in various Option videos like <a href="http://youtu.be/wbabFQeY2ro?t=2m10s" target="_blank">this one</a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10186" alt="DSC_0176" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing that really jumped out at me, is why Ken kept putting his hand on his visor from time-to-time. Turns out, that when speed cameras take pictures, they MUST have a picture of your license plate AND your face. If you hide you face, they can't legally give you the ticket!!! much nicer than here in the US. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10187" alt="DSC_0177" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally arrived at Daikokufuto, but decided to do some scouting around on the outer areas to see if there was any drifting going on. Years back, ken used to go drifting here alot, so we went to check out some old spots he knew of.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10192" alt="DSC_0190" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We noticed this modified scooter, which looked pretty  cool<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10194" alt="DSC_0194" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also spotted another Mark II Chaser<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10196" alt="DSC_0196" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We kept finding cars scattered here and there, but no real action going on.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10198" alt="DSC_0198" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We stopped off at a small convenience store to grab some snacks, and decide whether to give up an head back to daikoku, or do some more exploring. By this time, it was already almos 2am, and I had to wake up in another 3 hours. &gt;&lt; Apparently, there was a big accident recently in the area when a car was drifting and slammed into a big crowd of people, killing a few. so, they moved on to some other areas. :\<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10199" alt="DSC_0199" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We followed around this R33 Skyline for a bit, before heading back over to daikoku<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10201" alt="DSC_0207" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Yet another skyline spotted! Its kind of funny how common they are over here compared to the couple that we have over in Seattle.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10202" alt="DSC_0208" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While it wasn't quite as crowded this time even though it was a saturday night, there were still plenty of interesting cars to check out. One of them being this Peugot or Citroen that had a huuge wing. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10203" alt="DSC_0209" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's the R32 that we spotted a few pictures above!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10204" alt="DSC_0210" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

There were a small group of FD's also gathered around. All of them were pretty clean too!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10206" alt="DSC_0213" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This red one I especially thought looked awesome.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10208" alt="DSC_0215" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Off in the corner was this guy in another FD doing some quick tuning on his laptop, before heading out for some more wangan runs I assume. I chatted with him for a bit, bit he didn't seem to be in the mood. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10210" alt="DSC_0217" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One car that was REALLY unexpected was this Mclaren MP4-12C!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10212" alt="DSC_0220" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its hard to describe how amazing this car looks and sounds in person!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10213" alt="DSC_0221" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A par of these nice Supras were also found off in the corner.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10214" alt="DSC_0222" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

At some point, I really would love to ride in one of these guys!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10215" alt="DSC_0223" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Oddly enough, just as we were leaving was first time seeing a R34 during this trip! haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10218" alt="DSC_0226" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I didn't realize was that they turn the lights off on Tokyo Tower after midnight in order to save power. By this time it was already 3am, and I needed to get some kind of sleep before Derek came banging on my hotel door at 6am. lol I can't wait to get back out to the Wangan in a proper car, and do some high speed runs! ^_^  Huge thanks to Ken for driving around everywhere, and coming out to Tokyo to meetup!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10219" alt="DSC_0229" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>
