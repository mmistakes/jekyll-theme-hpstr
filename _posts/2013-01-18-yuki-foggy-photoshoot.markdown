Well this week has shaped up to be a good start to 2013. I managed to get a new job at my friend's company doing more Linux/IT stuff, and the company seems like a great fit. While I was sitting at home this morning, the weather went from clear skies and sunny, to heavy fog. So, I took the chance to try and take some pictures, and play around with my Nikon D5100 a bit more. More after the jump, Enjoy! :p
