<p>Just a quick update, I finally got around to swapping out Yuki’s Transmission fluid today with some Amsoil 75w90 GL-4 fluid. So far, after driving it today I can’t believe how much of a difference this has made!</p>  <p>Props go out to Ken(slider2828) for recommending this stuff to me, since I had always assumed most synthetic fluids were roughly the same. Even though my tranny already felt pretty good since its been rebuilt, its even better with the new fluid. Feels like I just drove it off the production lot and smooth as butta! haha Here’s a pic of the stuff I got. For those of you in Washington State, I picked my stuff up at Action Autoparts. Apparently they carry a bunch of other amsoil products too.</p>  <p>Anyways, like I was saying make sure you get this stuff. the FSM for s13’s recommend GL-4 fluid, and I think amsoil also makes some stuff in GL-5.</p>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px" src="http://www.skspeed.com/images-dyn/ProductImages/Thumb/AMZMTG.jpg" /></p>
