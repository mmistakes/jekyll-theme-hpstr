Last year when I started mainstream programming, I never thought I'd love this, this much. I see a very good year ahead, even though there are a lot of obstacles Ill have to go through this year, this year already started with something amazing, I was made the mentor of Google Code-In for Zulip. And boy, does it feel good. After I'm done with my exams in which I hope to get a CGPA above 8.0, I have a few things on my mind to keep my rest of the year occupied. 

* I'd like to give a shot for GSoC, and I'm okay even if I don't get selected for it because, the experience and the competition is worth it. And It'll teach me failure is not bad. You gain more from a failure anyway than from success (Some ancient proverb! LOL)
* I have developed a keen interest on Databases and management, so I started taking a few classes on SQL. Hopefully, that pays off too!
* I plan to complete atleast 75% of Algorithms by Cormen.
* And at last I'd like to do THE thing. I think its time to put my heart and soul into developing Colesk, even if its only me, I'd like to get it up and running by the end of this year because nothing can give one more pleasure than working on their dream.
