Hey everyone,

Yuki recently got some new Kensun 6k HID's, Q45 calipers,and a Kenwood deck so I figured I would post up about it. haha

HID's aside, the box they came in was super awesome. too bad it didn't come with a "Warning: TOP SECRET" label on it. lol

Recently, one of my Halogen bulbs went out, so I decided to make the jump to some 6k bi-xenon HID's.

We ran into some issues with my stock harness and realized that a couple of the copper connectors inside my plug were broken. Luckily, I just so happened to buy a little soldering iron at ACE Hardware the other day so, my buddy Mike put his soldering skills to the test. :p

Overall I'm pretty happy with these HID's. I have them in a set of Raybrig Purple/Blue housings and the resulting color is this cool Evergreen/Blue combo. haha My only gripe, is the cutoff line isn't quit what I would've liked, but its better than alot of other housings out there. *shrugs* I Figure its not bad when these housings were only designed for Halogen bulbs in the first place. haha

I also ended up replacing both front Q45 calipers. Come to find out, both sides had a seized piston even though they were only 4-6 months old.... The passenger side stated to get a bunch of rust on it, and when I checked behind the piston boot, it was caked in there. So, something tells me whoever put these back together didn't do a very good job.

Let's hope I have better luck with these calipers. Granted, these are Iron, so rust is to be expected. Maybe once I take care of my SR, i'll switch to some aluminum Z32's or 350z brembo's ;) Also, my stopping power is ALOT better now that I actually have use of all 4 pistons. haha I'm actually surprised with how well I can stop without locking up the fronts now.

Lastly, I went on over to Car Toys on Lynnwood,WA the other day to see what they had for CD decks. I recently got an iPhone4s and wanted a newer deck to replace my old sony so I could take advantage of Bluetooth audio, and something hands free to talk on the phone when I'm driving. This Kenwood deck ended up being the result.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/deck_int.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6859" title="deck_int" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/deck_int.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" /></a>

Quick shot of the deck installed. I was at my friend John's place after buying it, and he was kind enough to solder everything, and heat shrink it for me.^_^ Notice the external mic sitting by Yuki-chan? One cool feature I really like about this deck is the hands free, and auto answer features!

I actually had a kenwood deck in my first 240, and the one thing I think they did really well was navigation of settings and all that shtuff. This deck, also follows that same concept. so when you go into settings like.. 3 layers deep. all you need to do is push the back button 3 times to get back to the main menu so to speak. I really like this type of setup over the Sony deck I had.

Anyways, this is getting long winded. lol So far, I'm happy with the deck, but the settings don't appear to be right. The bass overloads both my front 6" speakers and rear 6x9" ones. So, I'm heading over to Mike's place today to get stuff fine tuned, and also test out his 10" sub. My 6x9"s are pretty old, so maybe they'll need replacing soon as well. lol
