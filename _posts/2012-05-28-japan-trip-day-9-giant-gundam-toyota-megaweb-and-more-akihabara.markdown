Day 9 of my trip was mostly spend hanging out with my buddy Darrick around the Odaiba area and going to Akihabara as well.

First step of the day involved heading over to Haneda Airport to pickup my buddy Darrick.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8424" title="DSC_0001" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00014.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Afterwards, we took the new Yurikamome across the rainbow bay bridge over to Odaiba.

After getting off at the right station, we decided to hunt around Aqua City for the mcdonalds and grab some lunch. The bigger building with the ball on it, is actually the main HQ for Fuji TV.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00104.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8431" title="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00104.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

We got a bit distracted and somehow ended up Tebowing infront of the statue of liberty.haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00172.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8437" title="DSC_0017" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00172.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I found this familiar shop called Daiso, which they have in Seattle. However, this one was HUGE compared to the previous ones ive seen.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00273.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8442" title="DSC_0027" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00273.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally made it to mcdonalds to grab some food, and were joined by this little guy. ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00325.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8445" title="DSC_0032" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00325.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to headout after lunch to try and find the giant gundam. Along the way, this clean caged porsche was spotted.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00334.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8446" title="DSC_0033" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00334.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also this wagon sporting some TE37's.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00534.jpg"><img title="DSC_0053" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00534.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Finally found him! the thing was massive!

&nbsp;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8404" title="aIMG_0303" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0303-e1338280422210.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

We managed to get lucky and catch the Gundam just as the whole light/smoke show was starting. We were a bit dissappointed to find out that, it only did those things, plus the head moved. We had thought the arms n stuff moved as well. oh well...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00503.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8456" title="DSC_0050" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00503.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<strong>EDIT:</strong> Totally forgot to include this photo of my Tebow'ing infornt of the gundam! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00654.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8469" title="DSC_0065" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00654.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I decided to go checkout the Gundam Cafe here in Odaiba to see what was different from the one in Akihabara. Luckily I did, because they had this little combo snack, plus a limited edition Gundam head which I ended up getting. ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00745.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8476" title="DSC_0074" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00745.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After the gundam stuff, we headed down the road to another attraction called Palette town. Which, due to the nice rainbow colored sign, looks very warm and welcoming......right?

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00834.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8482" title="DSC_0083" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00834.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We finally had found the Toyota History Garage over at the MegaWeb area.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00883.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8487" title="DSC_0088" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00883.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had some really old school iconic cars lined up here!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00894.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8488" title="DSC_0089" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00894.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

For example, this 1974 TA27 Toyota Celica.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00912.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8490" title="DSC_0091" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00912.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

or this 1967 Toyota Celica 2000GT!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00982.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8497" title="DSC_0098" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00982.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The next room was a long hallway of display cases, with Toy models, magazines, and other misc stuff to buy.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01062.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8504" title="DSC_0106" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01062.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a really cool RS Turbo R31 Skyline we spotted for 19,900Yen(roughly $200)

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01073.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8505" title="DSC_0107" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01073.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Check out that awesome F1 Steering wheel/Clock!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01104.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8508" title="DSC_0110" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01104.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Here's a little Ayrton Senna model that was sitting on the counter as I was checking out to buy a few things.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01123.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8510" title="DSC_0112" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01123.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They even had a cool Delorean like from Back to the Future!

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01144.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8512" title="DSC_0114" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01144.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

hmmm a Gran Prix Garage? let's see whats down here...

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01152.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8513" title="DSC_0115" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01152.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Going down the stairs there was this really cool Castrol Toyota Celica GT-FOUR painting.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01213.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8518" title="DSC_0121" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01213.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Well, I wasn't dissappointed. Sitting here was a Formula 1 car driven by Alan Mcnish, that look really smaller than I thought it would in person. But, it was something really awesome to see.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01202.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8517" title="DSC_0120" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01202.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They had this really cool overhead video, complete with real time telemetry on the laptop, and info there on the steering wheel. I took video of this for a bit, so check the link at the bottom of the post. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01232.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8519" title="DSC_0123" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01232.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Next up was this completely MINT showroom Toyota Corolla Levin from 1983. words cannot begin to describe how cool of an experience this was. I really wanted to see what it looked like inside the engine bay though. &gt;_&lt;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01253.jpg"><img title="DSC_0125" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01253.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I couldn't get over how cleanthis thing was. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01261.jpg"><img title="DSC_0126" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01261.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This version was also a GTV which is the highest model you could get.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01292.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8525" title="DSC_0129" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01292.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Moving onto the outside stuff, this poor Castrol Toyota Celica GT-FOUR longs for the day it can drive in a rally stage again.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8526" title="DSC_0130" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01303.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Even though the car was a bit battered, and rusted, it seemed to be in pretty good shape for the most part.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01392.jpg"><img title="DSC_0139" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01392.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

'gotta love the engrish on the intake piping cover! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01333.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8529" title="DSC_0133" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01333.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also outside was this cool looking 24hour LeMans car.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0145.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8538" title="DSC_0145" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0145.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Back upstairs they had this SuperGT Toyota Supra and Red Bull F1 car from 2005.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0155.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8544" title="DSC_0155" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0155.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

Back in the other building by the Toyota City Showcase, they had test drives setup along this small course. We asked about testing the new 86, but it would involve waiting a solid 3-4 hours. So, we decided to go play with the display models instead. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01581.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8546" title="DSC_0158" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01581.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="936" /></a>

The red one on the left was Automatic, and the Silver one to the right was Manual.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01601.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8548" title="DSC_0160" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01601.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

SMH, Epic Fail Toyota... you just had to put the stupid boxer motor in it....*sigh*

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8555" title="DSC_0169" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01691.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This picture is misleading. While I was giving a thumbs up, I should've been giving thumbs down. While this interior does look much better than the stupid crap we're getting from the Scion FT-86. It still kinda fails with the steering wheel felling like a musting, and almost everything being covered in suede. Overall I just think that Toyota didn't listen to the right people when they were working on building this car..&gt;_&lt;

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01833.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8564" title="DSC_0183" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01833.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

They also had this cool GT5 simulator setup for people to try.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8565" title="DSC_0184" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01841.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

back in another store they had some cool F1 helmets worn by Jean Alesi

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01861.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8567" title="DSC_0186" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01861.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Also this Personal steering wheel signed by Michael Schumacher.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01891.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8569" title="DSC_0189" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01891.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

a quick overview shot of the second building which was called Toyota MegaWeb.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01992.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8578" title="DSC_0199" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01992.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Next stop for the day was the giant Super Autobacs store in Shinonome. notice the Toyota Chaser there in the corner?

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0305.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8406" title="aIMG_0305" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0305-e1338283361940.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

This Super Autobacs was very similar to the one up in Gunma, except this one just had a bit more stuff. Especially Bubble Shifters! Sadly, they were alot stricter with taking pictures and I was forced to use my phone, which doesn't always focus properly. lol

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0204.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8583" title="DSC_0204" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0204.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On our way out this Silvia was heard, and the guy was checking something with the engine since he kept revving it. There's a video link below at the bottom of the post for this. ^_^

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0310.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8410" title="aIMG_0310" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0310-e1338283608614.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

This is one of the reasons I would much rather live outside the city like in Yokohama or even Gunma than directy in Tokyo. There's just too many damn people. lol This was taken on our way to Akihabara.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0314.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8414" title="aIMG_0314" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0314-e1338283709785.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="465" /></a>

back at the UDX Parking area we spotted this wierd Mercedes Smart car thingy..

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8588" title="DSC_0211" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02111.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

more S15 Itasha awesomeness! This time its Yui from the show Angel Beats who's in the band Girls Dead Monster.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02142.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8591" title="DSC_0214" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02142.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

This clean MR-S was hanging around as well.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0319.jpg"><img title="aIMG_0319" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0319-e1338284106291.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="826" /></a>

We decided to go back up to street level to check more stuff out, and ran into this meido wearing neko-mimi. she looks lost, maybe we should help her. :p

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02222.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8598" title="DSC_0222" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02222.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to go to this regular Maid Cafe since I couldn't find any Tsundere ones on Darrick's iPhone. However, when we entered they made sure we knew that there was no english(which wasn't a problem) and that there's also a 5,000Yen($5 USD) seat fee. The place was pretty packed, and we figured we've seen enough maids, so we decided not to stick around. They didn't allow cameras in there obviously, so I wasn't able to take any pictures, but just from watching for a few minutes, its pretty cool and full of moe-overload. haha

After scoping out Akihabara, we went back to my hotel to rest up for a bit before going to grab dinner. Once we popped the TV on, I noticed that the Yokohama Bay Stars were playing. lol

We ended up eating at this Family Resteraunt since they had the most variety, and Darrick's a pretty picky eater. lol

I totally forgot to take a picture of my Beef stew I ordered, but luckily I remembered the Cheescake Pudding Parfait I ordered.

One thing that was funny, is darrick has asked if the parfaits will be big. I told him "nah, it'll be a little small probably." well, for mine that was the case, but not his. haha The ice cream on his was suuper sweet, so neither he nor I could eat all of it. lol

Day 10 will probably be spent catching up on all of my blogging form the past 3 days, and sending Darrick off to Narita Airport.

Here's video of stuff from today:
