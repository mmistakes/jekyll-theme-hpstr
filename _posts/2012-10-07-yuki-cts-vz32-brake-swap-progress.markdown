hey everyone,

So, I posted earlier in the summer about my plans to swap out the brakes with yuki. Things ended up going a bit slower than planned, so I'm slightly behind. Let me bring you up to speed on where i'm at now with her. ;)

Before doing anything I needed to source some used OEM knuckles for the brakes. The reason for this, is my current 97' Q45 setup up front, required the mount holes on the knuckle to be drilled out bigger, to fit the giant bolts. Luckily, with the CTS-V setup, the brackets use oem size bolts. So, to keep the theme the same, I sprayed these in some hi-temp silver.

Here's the final result. Overall, I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.

Next up, was sourcing the pads from the EVO VIII which are the same as the CTS-V. This will enable me to run alot more aggressive pads that anything I would find for the CTS-V. As I mentioned earlier, I decided to go with the Project Mu HC+(High Carbon Plus) all around.

I used to have a set of PMU's on my first 240, and aside from them dusting alot, I loved them. They had really good bite, and didn't fade with my stock brakes at the time. Since then, i've researched that they improved on the dusting issue, specifically with these version of pads. So, I'm excited to see how they perform.

This is how the front setup has been sitting in my room for the past couple weeks...:( Very soon, they finally be put to use. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ctsv_dba_rotors.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8848" title="ctsv_dba_rotors" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ctsv_dba_rotors.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /></a>

Of course, you couldn't have good breaks, without good rotors. So, I decided to go with these beefy 13" Slotted EVO VIII rotors from DBA. They're 1pc sadly, so they're kinda heavy. I really would've liked to go with the 2pc with aluminum hat, but at $450 a rotor, it was a bit outside my budget for now. hehe

Moving on to the rear setup, I managed to source the Z32 ebrake hubs I needed as well as some used drilled/slotted rotors. Initially before starting this venture, I thought that all Z32 stuff was the some. <strong>THIS IS NOT TRUE!</strong>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img0001uc.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8851" title="z32_anchor_bolt" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/img0001uc.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>
See the difference here? These are the ebrake anchor bolts. To keep it simple, it's a critical part for getting your ebrake shoes to work properly. The fatter one on the right there is only found on the 1990 N/A 300ZX.

The reason for this, is that the Z32 hub actually has slightly different spacing in 1990 or lackthereof really, than all the other versions. The Z32 hub has a plate that the anchor bolt goes onto. This rises the anchor bolt about 6mm which accounts for the difference in space over the thicker one. It's a common mistake people have been making when doing 5lug/z32 swaps into their S13's from what i've seen.

let's put all the fact's i've researched into one place. The following is what's needed depending on the hub you're using.

<strong>S13 4lug, Ichiba 5lug conversion, R32 GTS-T, Z32 1990 hubs = Thicker anchor bolt</strong>

<strong>Z32 91+, S14, R32 GTR hubs = Thinner anchor bolt</strong>

Luckily, for those of you that happen to run into the issue of having the wrong anchor bolt, don't worry about digging for another set. I found a place that sells just the thicker anchor bolt, since its discontinued from Nissan now..:(

Anyways, I only need the following items in order to finish up and get this thing all bolted on.

<strong>-Z32 2+2 ebrake cables</strong>

<strong>-Z32 rear calipers</strong>

<strong>-Z32 rear PMU HC+ Pads</strong>

So, I'll update you guys again once I get everything finished and bolted up!
