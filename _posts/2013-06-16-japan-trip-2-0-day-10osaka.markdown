hey everyone, here's anther post from my japan trip. I'm slowly getting through these, so bear with me! :p
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10004" alt="DSC_0040" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<!--more-->After being a bit tired from arriving to kansai area, and then going up to kyoto the day before, I decided to sleep in a bit, and meetup with my friend Eriko around lunchtime. We first headed over to Shimbashi in osaka.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9975" alt="DSC_0006" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0006.jpg" width="620" height="410" />
</a>

Right away found the awesome Glico runner who's on a bunch of Pocky boxes and also that I suck at playing copycat! :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9973" alt="DSC_0004" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0004.jpg" width="620" height="936" />
</a>

Apparently, this bridge is called nanpa bridge due to the huge amounts of guys from host clubs that try to solicit girls to come hang out at the bar/club at night. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9976" alt="DSC_0007" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0007.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I noticed about Osaka, is even though it was in the middle of the afternoon on a monday, it still was nowhere near as crowded as tokyo! lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9977" alt="DSC_0008" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0008.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The signs here are also alot different. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9979" alt="DSC_0010" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0010.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Apparently, Osaka is home to alot of famous comedians. None of which, I know about. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9980" alt="DSC_0011" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After checking out a few places, we decided to stop and grab some Takoyaki, since osaka is famous for it. The Takoyaki i've had here in seattle isn't bad, but doesn't compare at all to the ones here. haha Also, even for a tourist place, food is relatively cheap in japan. 6 of them costed us only $3.50 ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10007" alt="IMG_1310" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

The only downside, is when you first get it. You almost always have to wait a good 5 minutes before eating, unless you like scalding the entire insides of your mouth. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10008" alt="IMG_1311" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

One thing Osaka is popular for is their mascot called Billiken. He'sa bit similar to the buhdda, except instead of rubbing his belly for luck, you rub his feet. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9981" alt="DSC_0012" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I did think these semi-indoor malls were pretty near. They stretched for quite a ways too! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9982" alt="DSC_0013" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Managed to randomly find the NMB48 Theatre! which is basically the Osaka version of Tokyo's popular AKB48 Idol Group.W<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9989" alt="DSC_0021" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

While venturing around, I noticed this really cool parking garage. Instead of having a big spiral going up like most of the ones in the US, they just use a little crane, and lift the car up onto its proper spot!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9990" alt="DSC_0022" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We started to get into the Otaku side of town. Earlier, I was pretty surprised when emiko randomly said "メイドカフェ行こう！"(Lets go to a maid cafe!) I had wanted to actually go to one since the last time I visited japan, but walking in my yourself is a bit intimidating. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9991" alt="DSC_0023" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We ended up going to this place, which was one of the few ones that was open a bit earlier for lunch service! One thing its worth noting about maid cafe's is you're not allowed to take pictures....USUALLY. I went into 007 covert ops mode to take some pics. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9997" alt="DSC_0029" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

When we walked in we were greated by this super cute girl in a pikachu themes maid outfit. I'm guessing she's the one who wrote on the sign board above. haha The place started to get super busy a little after we put in our order. So, I felt a bit bad for her. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10009" alt="IMG_1315" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg" width="816" height="612" />
</a>

The menu had standard japanese cafe items like melon soda, cakes, ect.. I decided to go with the standard of Omlete Rice! :p Naturlly, which she drew a pikachu on! haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10010" alt="IMG_1316" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

Emiko ended up getting some chocalate cake, which she managed to eat while resisting the urge to destroy her chocolate kitten. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10011" alt="IMG_1317" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

One thing japan is super popular for with gambling is pachinko. They had these huge pachinko parlous everywhere, and this one I thought was pretty interesting since they had some copy of Marlyn Monroe. lol <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9984" alt="DSC_0015" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another thing I thought was amazing, is this guy's old man stength! 0_o he was able to pull all these stuff around by himself!! lol He's putting homeless people or recycle gather people in the US to SHAME. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9998" alt="DSC_0030" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Sadly, after taking some pictures with these random people, emiko had to head off to work. So, I went back to my room for a few hours, before heading out again to meetup with another one of my friends.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9985" alt="DSC_0017" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After taking a short break for a few hours, I headed out again. Only to notice this super sweet 50's style luxury car. Something tells me its a Rolls Royce or a Bentley due to the front, but I'm not completely sure. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10012" alt="IMG_1318" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

I also spotted this really clean Toyota Prius that was lightly modded.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9993" alt="DSC_0025" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Just before I got to the subway station, I noticed this super clean BMW just sitting there outside of the rain, wanting its pictures taken. :p So, I kindly obliged. haha

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10001" alt="DSC_0035" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10018" alt="DSC_0038" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

After meeting up at Osaka Station, our first stop of the afternoon was to go checkout Shinsekai which basically means "New World" although, that was a looong time ago, so now its more like.. "Old World". haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10003" alt="DSC_0039" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

We decided to go check out that huge wield looking tower called Tsutenkaku<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10004" alt="DSC_0040" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once at the top you could see all the different parts of Osaka!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10006" alt="DSC_0042" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Its safe to say, I had no clue what I was looking at for the most part. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10005" alt="DSC_0041" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10029" alt="DSC_0045" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Inside they had this really odd Billiken collection.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10028" alt="DSC_0044" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way back to the bottom they had some misc shops that features a ton of Glico productions, namely Pocky. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10013" alt="IMG_1320" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

aaand more pocky<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10015" alt="IMG_1323" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

aand the tower made out of Glico snacks. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10014" alt="IMG_1321" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg" width="612" height="816" /></a>

On the next level things got even wierder. Running into this huge collection of Ultimate Muscle(Kinniku Man) stuff that Megumi started lecturing me on. ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10031" alt="DSC_0047" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I dunno, I think I can take him! <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10030" alt="DSC_0046" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>

They also had these life-sized pieces from some of the various characters too.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10032" alt="DSC_0048" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Once we got to the bottom, Megumi suggest we go try some Kansai style food called Kushikatsu. Which, is like regular katsu, but skrewed cabob style. lol It was actually super tastey, and you basically pick the combo you want, and they keep bringing you stuff. It's not very filling, but great for a snack! ^_^
<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10016" alt="IMG_1324" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324-e1371410126245.jpg" width="816" height="612" /></a>

After checking out Shinsekai, we went back to the main Osaka station to check out this new mall called Grant Front Osaka. Apparently it just opened a week prior.<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10033" alt="DSC_0049" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0049.jpg" width="620" height="410" />

here it is, in all its glory. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10034" alt="DSC_0050" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Megumi was actually pretty excited to check it out, since she lives in this area, but hadn't yet been there. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10035" alt="DSC_0051" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The mall is actually split up into two different sides. This being the backside of the above building, which has mostly regular shopping stores. And the other building has mostly food and other types of stores.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10051" alt="DSC_0077" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Here's a quick shot from between the buildings down at the street.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0052" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

The inside was actually pretty amazing, and it felt like one of the bigger malls you would see in California or something. <a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10043" alt="DSC_0061" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

But, just alot more levels to it. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10042" alt="DSC_0060" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Right when we stepped outside, there was this really cool bench area where you could sit and hangout at. Sadly, it was raining, so I only enjoyed the view briefly.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg"><img alt="DSC_0064" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Looks like Osaka also has a ferris wheel, but apparently it doesn't compare to the giant one over in Yokohama.(which I didnt get a chance to visit this time)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10023" alt="DSC_0069" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10048" alt="DSC_0068" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Apparently, there was still some ways to go if you really wanted to get to the very top of the second building. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10049" alt="DSC_0071" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way back we spotted this really cool resteraunt with this pool on the side. Nightlife in japan is really awesome compared to Seattle. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10050" alt="DSC_0076" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

From the balcony of this resteraunt area, I spotted this corner that looks like it needs some extra tire marks! ;)<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10053" alt="DSC_0079" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

A quick look at one of the giant department stores next to the mall.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10054" alt="DSC_0080" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Overall while the entire day was exhausting, and a bit wet and damp, I had a great time in Osaka! I'd like to come back again sometime for more than just 2 days to do a bit more exploring. lol Thanks to Megumi, and Eriko for showing me around! Tomorrow, is time to getup super early, and head all the way back north to visit my friend's up in Gunma again! ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10052" alt="DSC_0078" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>
