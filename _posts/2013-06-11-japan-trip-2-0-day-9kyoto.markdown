man...a bit late again on these. I've been recovering the past week or so and trying to get caught back up to speed here in Seattle. With that said, I'll be trying to push out a new one of these everyday until the end (Day 14).

First Order of the day was to leave my hotel in Shizuoka that Hideko and Natsuko were kind enough to help me out with, and get on the Bullet Train once again to head for Osaka which is in the Kansai region! But, before I could do that I took advantage of the free breakfast. lol I wasn't feeling very hungry, so I just grabbed some stuff to tide me over until lunchtime.

<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1286.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9957" alt="IMG_1286" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1286.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

Then it was time to hop on the Shinkansen(Bullet Train) down to Osaka. If I remember correctly, it was about a 2 hour trip.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1290.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9958" alt="IMG_1290" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1290.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

You can definitly tell a difference between tokyo, and out here in the countryside. Personally, I like it out here alot more. Tokyo is just way too crowded to me. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1293.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9960" alt="IMG_1293" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1293.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

After lugging all my crap around, I finally made it to the place I was staying at in Osaka! (Note: next time I come to japan, I'm not bringing anything back) haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9906" alt="DSC_0111" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0111.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

One thing that made my Shinkansen trip much more enjoyable were these rare magazines I was given by Hideki over at Garage Miura! ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1308.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9965" alt="IMG_1308" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1308.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

I was able to take a quick shower, and then head off to Kyoto to meetup with my friend Yuka from Seattle and do some exploring.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0122.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9911" alt="DSC_0122" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0122.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

There's this wierd difference between Tokyo and Osaka. If I had to compare the two, while both are big cities, Osaka feels a bit more like Seattle, and Tokyo feels more like New York.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9916" alt="DSC_0127" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

On the way to the subway I noticed this awesome Nissan Truck!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9917" alt="DSC_0128" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

This is what you're greeted with when you step outside the main entrance from Kyoto Station! Reminds me alot of the Space Needle. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1300.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9962" alt="IMG_1300" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1300.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

Shortly thereafter, I metup with Yuka, and we started cruising around town. Apparently, this cat cafe is pretty famous! 0_o<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9922" alt="DSC_0134" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

And even though it says no taking pictures...I did anyways. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9921" alt="DSC_0133" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

I was actually a bit surprised with how crowded it was on a weekday afternoon.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9925" alt="DSC_0137" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Kyoto definitly seems to be a really popular tourist town! It still has that sense of old fashion japanese to it as well.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9929" alt="DSC_0142" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

One thing I've always liked is how Japan always has alot of places to just chill and relax even in the cities.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9931" alt="DSC_0144" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Apparently, its a popular date spot as well. heh *insert angry rant about being single here*<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9930" alt="DSC_0143" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Here's a quick shot at one of the back-alley temples I found.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9933" alt="DSC_0147" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

I also was able to check out this famous temple called Yasakajinja.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9936" alt="DSC_0153" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Naturally had to take my tourist-style pic as well with yuka. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9937" alt="DSC_0155" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Farther inside the temple, they had these huge ropes with bells attached to them. According to Yuka, they're for making wishes at. Similar to wishing wells that we have in the US.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9942" alt="DSC_0161" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

Another intersting thing I ran into, was this sign of bad luck based on certain ages. Luckily, my age of 23 wasn't on there so I don't need to worry. :p<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9940" alt="DSC_0159" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

It was starting to get dark, but luckily alot of my pictures ended up turning out alright.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9944" alt="DSC_0163" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

As we were walking around looking for a place to eat, we decided to call up another one of our friend's from Seattle to see if he wanted to join us.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9945" alt="DSC_0169" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Yuka, our friend Takeshi and I decided to go eat at this Nagoya-style place called Yama-chan. They had some pretty interesting old-school posters outside also. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9966" alt="yama-chan" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

&nbsp;

We ended up eating some chicken wings, ham katsu(which was AMAZIN), friend rice, and croquettes!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg"><img alt="IMG_1302" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg" width="620" height="465" /></a>

Desert were these japanese sweet potatoes w/ vanilla ice cream.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9964" alt="IMG_1303" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg" width="620" height="826" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After dinner, I spotted this Cop car tucked away in some corner alley. lol<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9946" alt="DSC_0170" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

I was actually quite surprised how active Kyoto was at night. It kind of seemed like a tourist area that would only be active during the daytime. haha<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9948" alt="DSC_0173" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

I also spotted this wanna-be AKB48 bar. AKB48 is a japanese idol group consisting of 48 girls from Tokyo's Akihabara district. hence the AKB. Osaka/Kyoto have their own version of this called NMB48, which you'll see in a later post! ^_^<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9949" alt="DSC_0175" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On the way back to the station I spotted this wierd van slammed on some chrome wheels. It looked really funny in person.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9950" alt="DSC_0176" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

Here you can get a cool reflection of the Kyoto Tower off of the side of Kyoto Station<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9952" alt="DSC_0181" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

I'm always amazed at how beautiful Japan is specifically at night. Especially being in the city, everything looks really cool.<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0184.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9953" alt="DSC_0184" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0184.jpg" width="620" height="410" /></a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was time to head back to Osaka and get some rest before getting up to do some more exploring the next day. It was great to catch up with my friend's Yuka and Takeshi and hopefully next time i'll go check out some more stuff like Kinkakujin(golden temple)!<a href="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9955" alt="DSC_0189" src="http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg" width="620" height="936" /></a>
