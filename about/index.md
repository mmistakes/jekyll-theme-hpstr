* [Scripts Pack for macOS](https://phorofor.github.io/ScriptsPack.macOS/): *Scripts that toggle various settings of macOS. This was intended for those who had some sort of network account restrictions imposed, only allowing default macOS applications to be run. The goal of each script done was to be done entirely in AppleScript without any additional third party applications.*
