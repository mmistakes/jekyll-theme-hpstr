### Colesk 

Well, as of today there is a considerable distance between colleges in the world. Colesk acts as a medium for colleges to interact, collaborate and to bring them together. It is a Social Network for making the life of a college student more productive. Colesk is completely transparent and the only thing you can decide your privacy on is your own profile. 

Colesk can be used as a medium to share opinions and to make a change. One can use the Anonymous feature of Colesk to share their opinion without having to reveal themselves.

I plan to develop this software as an open source after I get some experience working with real projects.
