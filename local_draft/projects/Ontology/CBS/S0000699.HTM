Role of a subject enabling it to act purposefully.

CBS V2: - A role of a &quot;Subject&quot; which indicates that it has power to act
<BR>

<BR>
This is a role which may be played by a &quot;Subject&quot;. Sometimes, an &quot;Agent&quot; may be created in order to
assemble a set of responsibilities and authorities prior to a specific &quot;Subject&quot; being identified
and allocated to it.
<BR>

<BR>
For purposes of creating an &quot;Authorising Act&quot;, an &quot;Agent&quot; may actually be a group of individuals -
for example when joint responsibility is being taken for some decision, as in a clinical case
conference.  In such a case the details of the group are taken care of by &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Inter
Subject Relationship&quot;.
<BR>

<BR>
Examples of &quot;Agent&quot;:
<BR>
Dr Smithers within NHS XYZ Trust, 
<BR>
Ms J.Doe in the HXT Pathology laboratory.
<BR>

<BR>
A better understanding of the types of &quot;Agent&quot; can be gained from examination of its subtypes.

<DT><Font size=3>Comment: 
<DD><B>
The word &quot;known&quot; should be emphasised; many events which are perceived as incidents (eg terrorist
bombs) are in fact activities when viewed from a different perspective. It's all to do with where
you are sitting.
<BR>

<BR>
The definition above, as for others, has been distilled from what has been suggested in the past,
including:
<BR>

<BR>
A distinct or definite occurrence. An event (sic) (CBS v2).
<BR>
&quot;Event&quot; occurring without volition (of an &quot;Agent&quot;).
<BR>
Unintentional occurrence.
