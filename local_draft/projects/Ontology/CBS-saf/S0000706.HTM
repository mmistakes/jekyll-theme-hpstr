CBS V2: - A role of a &quot;Subject&quot; which indicates that it has power to act
<BR>

<BR>
This is a role which may be played by a &quot;Subject&quot;. Sometimes, an &quot;Agent&quot; may be created in order to
assemble a set of responsibilities and authorities prior to a specific &quot;Subject&quot; being identified
and allocated to it.
<BR>

<BR>
For purposes of creating an &quot;Authorising Act&quot;, an &quot;Agent&quot; may actually be a group of individuals -
for example when joint responsibility is being taken for some decision, as in a clinical case
conference.  In such a case the details of the group are taken care of by &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Inter
Subject Relationship&quot;.
<BR>

<BR>
Examples of &quot;Agent&quot;:
<BR>
Dr Smithers within NHS XYZ Trust, 
<BR>
Ms J.Doe in the HXT Pathology laboratory.
<BR>

<BR>
A better understanding of the types of &quot;Agent&quot; can be gained from examination of its subtypes.

Agent&#47;authorisation (Generalization Node)</font></A><BR>

Identifies whether the &quot;Agent&quot; is authorised to undertake specific activities or whether they are
acting under their own volition.
<BR>

<BR>
Problem: In practical terms, it is likely that an implementation will not know whether an &quot;Agent&quot; is
authorised or not. Similarly, because &quot;Agent&quot; is a join between a &quot;Person&quot; and another authorising
&quot;Agent&quot;, then in order to establish the appropriate &quot;Agent&quot; it is necessary to know both the
&quot;Person&quot; and the authorising &quot;Agent&quot;. What if only the &quot;Person&quot; is known?

Authorised Agent (Class)</font></A><BR>
<DL>
<DT><Font size=3>Description: <B>
&quot;Agent&quot; whose actions are subject to another's authority and control.
</B></font><BR>
<DT><Font size=3>Comment: 
<DD><B>
The type of control would include permissions (may do), obligations (must do) and interdictions
(must not do).
<BR>

<BR>
An &quot;Agent&quot; who invests authority in another shares some liability for the actions of those to whom
it gives authority.
<BR>

<BR>
An example of an &quot;Authorised Agent &quot; would be Dr. Smithers given the authority by the NHS XYZ Trust
to run the Medical Clinical Directorate.

&quot;Authorised Agents&quot; operate within the bounds of their authority. However, the model needs to
account for the possibility of actions being undertaken outside these limits. Patients, for example,
where they perform activities, would normally do so as Free Agents.
<BR>

<BR>
An example of acting outside the bounds set would be where a person working for an NHS Trust
operates an illicit sideline selling confectionery. In this case the person is operating as a &quot;Free
Agent&quot; relative to the NHS Trust.
