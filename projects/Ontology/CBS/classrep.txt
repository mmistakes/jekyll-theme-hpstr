	##pf3##Role of a subject enabling it to act purposefully.
	##pf4##CBS V2: - A role of a "Subject" which indicates that it has power to act
	
	This is a role which may be played by a "Subject". Sometimes, an "Agent" may be created in order to assemble a set of responsibilities and authorities prior to a specific "Subject" being identified and allocated to it.
	
	For purposes of creating an "Authorising Act", an "Agent" may actually be a group of individuals - for example when joint responsibility is being taken for some decision, as in a clinical case conference.  In such a case the details of the group are taken care of by 
	"Subject" and "Inter Subject Relationship".
	
	Examples of "Agent":
	Dr Smithers within NHS XYZ Trust, 
	Ms J.Doe in the HXT Pathology laboratory.
	
	A better understanding of the types of "Agent" can be gained from examination of its subtypes.
