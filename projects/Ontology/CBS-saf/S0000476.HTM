This is the normal state of affairs - the Agency exists and is operational.
<BR>

<BR>
Note that in the case of an &quot;Authorised Agent&quot;, this is the point at which all &quot;Authorised
Activities&quot; become active, unless they have explicitly different start and end timepoints.

Note that there are both subtypes (comprising all the possible states) and a &quot;power type&quot; of &quot;Agent
State Type&quot;. The latter's contents are identical to the subtypes; it exists in order to control
topics such as access and permission to amend.
