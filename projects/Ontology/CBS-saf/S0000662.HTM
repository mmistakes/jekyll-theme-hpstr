CBS V2: - A role of a &quot;Subject&quot; which indicates that it has power to act
<BR>

<BR>
This is a role which may be played by a &quot;Subject&quot;. Sometimes, an &quot;Agent&quot; may be created in order to
assemble a set of responsibilities and authorities prior to a specific &quot;Subject&quot; being identified
and allocated to it.
<BR>

<BR>
For purposes of creating an &quot;Authorising Act&quot;, an &quot;Agent&quot; may actually be a group of individuals -
for example when joint responsibility is being taken for some decision, as in a clinical case
conference.  In such a case the details of the group are taken care of by &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Inter
Subject Relationship&quot;.
<BR>

<BR>
Examples of &quot;Agent&quot;:
<BR>
Dr Smithers within NHS XYZ Trust, 
<BR>
Ms J.Doe in the HXT Pathology laboratory.
<BR>

<BR>
A better understanding of the types of &quot;Agent&quot; can be gained from examination of its subtypes.

Note that there are both subtypes (comprising all the possible states) and a &quot;power type&quot; of
&quot;Intention State Type&quot;. The latter's contents are identical to the subtypes; it exists in order to
control topics such as access and permission to amend.
