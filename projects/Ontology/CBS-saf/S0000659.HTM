CBS V2: - A role of a &quot;Subject&quot; which indicates that it has power to act
<BR>

<BR>
This is a role which may be played by a &quot;Subject&quot;. Sometimes, an &quot;Agent&quot; may be created in order to
assemble a set of responsibilities and authorities prior to a specific &quot;Subject&quot; being identified
and allocated to it.
<BR>

<BR>
For purposes of creating an &quot;Authorising Act&quot;, an &quot;Agent&quot; may actually be a group of individuals -
for example when joint responsibility is being taken for some decision, as in a clinical case
conference.  In such a case the details of the group are taken care of by &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Inter
Subject Relationship&quot;.
<BR>

<BR>
Examples of &quot;Agent&quot;:
<BR>
Dr Smithers within NHS XYZ Trust, 
<BR>
Ms J.Doe in the HXT Pathology laboratory.
<BR>

<BR>
A better understanding of the types of &quot;Agent&quot; can be gained from examination of its subtypes.

Agent For Third Party (Class)</font></A><BR>
<DL>
<DT><Font size=3>Description: 
<DD><B>
&quot;Authorised Agent&quot; appointed or authorised to represent or act for another &quot;Agent&quot; .

<DT><Font size=3>Comment: 
<DD><B>
This covers the use of Proxy, an &quot;Agent&quot; acting for another &quot;Agent&quot;.
<BR>

<BR>
The authority for the proxy may or may not be the same as the represented &quot;Agent&quot;.  For example, the
parent or guardian of a juvenile is a proxy by law, not by the authority of the child.
