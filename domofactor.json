Which was just full of bad-luck streaks. I had just changed the oil, and did a tune up with new spark plugs and wires before crashing the car. I also had to drive to the biggest nissan meet f the year in my rental car(2009 Chevy mailbu). Then, I nearly lost my debit card just before the event. lol and to top if all off it was a week until my birthday when I had crashed it last march. So…yeah…that month wasn’t very kind to me. lol </p>  <p>Initially I couldn’t decide what car I wanted next, so I just started looking around at all kinds of cars. From rx-7’s to corolla’s. While, I always wanted a corolla, I wasn’t ready for the work that it takes to put in those cars just yet. I still felt like a 240 was the way to go. Then one day my buddy Jamie said that his brother reggie had his 240 just chillin at there house and that they were thinking of selling it. After going down to check it out, I had thought it was okay, but it needed some work.</p>  <p>The day I showed up to buy the car, it was running but just barely. the thing was like driving a smoke show, and for some reason ran suuuper rich. I totally smoke screened out the freeway, while driving up to the ferry in bremerton,wa. I used roughly 1/2 a tank driving only 20-40 miles. lol </p>  <p>Now, here’s the icing on the cake. After waiting in line for the ferry, It was time to start boarding. So, I go to start the car….and…..nothing. the thing would not start. I ended having to get pushed by essentially what was a forklift with a huge tire on the front, into an open parkinglot to fix the issue. After talking to my buddy ricky, he told me to pop the injectors out, and let the car idle till it runs out of gas. that thing probably ran for a good 2 minutes straight with NO injectors plugged in. So, deciding this motor had something up with it, we decided to put Anna under the knife, and stick my motor from the red car in it.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png\" />poor thing………</p>  <p>*side note: when we had the red car towed up to my buddy’s shop after I crashed it, we decided to have some fun with it. lol</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"0310001544\" border=\"0\" alt=\"0310001544\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>HELLA FLUSH! <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" alt=\"Winking smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png\" /></p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>  <p>we needed something to prop up the backend of this white S13 shell. then we realized, let’s put it ontop of my car! haha sadly, this is how it lived out the rest of it’s days before being towed off to the big racetrack in the sky <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png\" /></p>  <p>Anyways, back on topic!

I later sold this to my other friend tim, who has had zero problems with it what so ever… lol</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577301920_1456937958_1041913_3123202_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>doing some cleaning on the engine bay and prepping to stick the motor in.</p>  <p>Once we got the motor in, I as a lot happier. Since the single cam motors are pretty gutless compared to the dual-cam ones. Shortly thereafter I got my bucket seat&#160; and some other parts transferred over. It was then that I realized I needed a new steering wheel to fit in my bucket sit. lol</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28195_1440062529026_1456937958_1130084_7957583_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>The car had also came with some tein coils, and I gotta say. For a while I was pretty happy just driving another 240 again. But because I was so spoiled with a really clean car, I felt like this one would never be able to live up to the potential like my previous car. I was thinking about fixing all the body damage on the car, but I later found out the whole core support would have to be replaced.</p>  <p>I was just curious one day, and started looking at some 240’s again. I then came across this really clean cherry red one. Once I saw the phone number of who was selling it I immediately realized who it was. Just so happens to be it was the same old guy, that I bought my previous red car from. I still to this day don’t know why I just didn’t get a car from him in the first place. but so far I’m happy with how things have turned out. This is how the car was the first day I brang it home.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>the car was a perfect starter for me. the body was straight for the most part, the interior was clean, and the motor ran fine.

I’ve always had a domo on my car. even in the previous maroon and grey cars. So, now I’m kinda superstitious about not having one. haha^_^ I decided to go buy a new one for this car. lol</p>  <p>Since I had two cars, it gave me a chance to just daily drive the grey one, and start building up the red car. Since it was a really good base to start with, I figured I’d start coming up with some ideas on what to do. My friend ricky ended up giving me a few great ideas, and things just started going from there. But, you won’t get to see what that is quite yet. You’ll have to stick around for the next part of this to see what I have in store for the red car. <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" alt=\"Winking smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png\" /></p>  <p>Sorry for makin you guys read a novel again…like I said… it’s kind of a loong story. haha lemme know what you all think.

So, deciding this motor had something up with it, we decided to put Anna under the knife, and stick my motor from the red car in it.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/27264_1400577181917_1456937958_1041910_3387347_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p><img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png\" />poor thing………</p>  <p>*side note: when we had the red car towed up to my buddy’s shop after I crashed it, we decided to have some fun with it. lol</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"0310001544\" border=\"0\" alt=\"0310001544\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/0310001544.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>HELLA FLUSH! <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" alt=\"Winking smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png\" /></p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/40791_1534190202159_1456937958_1388827_5546494_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>  <p>we needed something to prop up the backend of this white S13 shell. then we realized, let’s put it ontop of my car! haha sadly, this is how it lived out the rest of it’s days before being towed off to the big racetrack in the sky <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png\" /></p>  <p>Anyways, back on topic!

For a while I was pretty happy just driving another 240 again. But because I was so spoiled with a really clean car, I felt like this one would never be able to live up to the potential like my previous car. I was thinking about fixing all the body damage on the car, but I later found out the whole core support would have to be replaced.</p>  <p>I was just curious one day, and started looking at some 240’s again. I then came across this really clean cherry red one. Once I saw the phone number of who was selling it I immediately realized who it was. Just so happens to be it was the same old guy, that I bought my previous red car from. I still to this day don’t know why I just didn’t get a car from him in the first place. but so far I’m happy with how things have turned out. This is how the car was the first day I brang it home.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n\" border=\"0\" alt=\"28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/28471_1480528940661_1456937958_1244297_3590572_n.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>  <p>the car was a perfect starter for me. the body was straight for the most part, the interior was clean, and the motor ran fine.

I’ve always had a domo on my car. even in the previous maroon and grey cars. So, now I’m kinda superstitious about not having one. haha^_^ I decided to go buy a new one for this car. lol</p>  <p>Since I had two cars, it gave me a chance to just daily drive the grey one, and start building up the red car. Since it was a really good base to start with, I figured I’d start coming up with some ideas on what to do. My friend ricky ended up giving me a few great ideas, and things just started going from there. But, you won’t get to see what that is quite yet. You’ll have to stick around for the next part of this to see what I have in store for the red car. <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" alt=\"Winking smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile4.png\" /></p>  <p>Sorry for makin you guys read a novel again…like I said… it’s kind of a loong story. haha lemme know what you all think.

I had never really payed much attention to the type-x stuff before. However, once I saw it in midnight purple I was drooling for days. lol Just to put it out there, I’m not necessarily trying to copy this car with my build, but  It was my plan to use certain things that I really liked from it, and then add my own style to things.\r\n\r\nNow,usually I don’t name my cars, but since this car is special I figured I could make an exception. lol I’ve decided to call this one Yuki(雪). Now initially you’re probably thinking “why are you calling this car yuki when it’s not even related to anything like snow or even white.” Well, theres some background story to that one. In the anime Haruhi Suzumiya my favorite character happens to be Nagato Yuki. Much like myself she tinkers with computers throughout the show. mostly because she’s an alient though, but you’ll have to actually watch the show to understand that one. Anyways, another reason for me naming this car yuki is because when I imagine her, I think the color purple(probably because of her hair). So.. yeah..\r\n\r\nAnother one of my goals for this car was to do things right, clean, and not flashy. For example this car has the dmax hood carbon and grenador side mirrors, and the flash red bride bucket seat. Mine will have none of that. But I did decide to go with the nice clean fitting OEM Type-X aero instead of the version select replica stuff. Because, frankly I would rather spend more money on parts that are durable and fit better.\r\n\r\nAlso, I won’t be doing any crazy motorswaps or anything. Since this is my Daily Driver and will be seeing track time only a few times a month I’m stickin to the ol’ faithful KA since it’s a really reliable motor if you treat it well. plus I’m poor <img class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" style=\"border-style: none;\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile6.png\" alt=\"Winking smile\" />\r\n\r\nAnyways, enough of my babbling.

I’ve got some freetime here at work so I figured I’d update the cliffhanger post from last week. lol ikuze!!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/1200.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"1200\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/1200.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"1200\" width=\"504\" height=\"379\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://csgarage.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">C’s garage</a> 180sx with the type-x kit and in midnight purple pictured above is one of my inspirations for building this new car. I had never really payed much attention to the type-x stuff before. However, once I saw it in midnight purple I was drooling for days. lol Just to put it out there, I’m not necessarily trying to copy this car with my build, but  It was my plan to use certain things that I really liked from it, and then add my own style to things.</p>\n\n<p>Now,usually I don’t name my cars, but since this car is special I figured I could make an exception. lol I’ve decided to call this one Yuki(雪). Now initially you’re probably thinking “why are you calling this car yuki when it’s not even related to anything like snow or even white.” Well, theres some background story to that one. In the anime Haruhi Suzumiya my favorite character happens to be Nagato Yuki. Much like myself she tinkers with computers throughout the show. mostly because she’s an alient though, but you’ll have to actually watch the show to understand that one. Anyways, another reason for me naming this car yuki is because when I imagine her, I think the color purple(probably because of her hair). So.. yeah..</p>\n\n<p>Another one of my goals for this car was to do things right, clean, and not flashy. For example this car has the dmax hood carbon and grenador side mirrors, and the flash red bride bucket seat. Mine will have none of that. But I did decide to go with the nice clean fitting OEM Type-X aero instead of the version select replica stuff. Because, frankly I would rather spend more money on parts that are durable and fit better.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I won’t be doing any crazy motorswaps or anything. Since this is my Daily Driver and will be seeing track time only a few times a month I’m stickin to the ol’ faithful KA since it’s a really reliable motor if you treat it well. plus I’m poor <img class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile\" style=\"border-style: none;\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile6.png\" alt=\"Winking smile\" /></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, enough of my babbling. I’ll get to the parts updates now. lol also, note we did all the bodywork by hand with a sanding block. Since, with a DA you have issues getting everything totally flat and smooth.

So, I'll be getting it rebuilt within the next month or so hopefully :p</p>\n\n<p>Well... that's it for now. Hopefully once I finish getting the tranny rebuilt I can give Yuki some track time! haha</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1305451694000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1406551378000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1305451694000,"published_by":1},{"id":1798,"uuid":"c9edf4da-ce7a-47bd-95e6-f9f183a7427c","title":"Shop Preview: Complete Garage RE-Sanai","slug":"shop-preview-complete-garage-re-sanai","markdown":"Hey guys!

With that said I'll make it a goal to be a bit more active around here this year. lol\r\n\r\nAnyways, I recently had some upgrades on Yuki that I wanted to share and have just been super lazy in posting them. I had heard great things from friends about how much of a difference getting a corner balance on your car was. So, I decided to fork up the cash and try it out.\r\n\r\nLuckily before doing so, Ken started talking to me and convinced me to get some new swift springs before going through with the corner balance. I was able to pick up a set for a great deal of $377 shipped for both sets from the guys over at <a href=\"http://shop.tougefactory.com/\">Touge Factory</a> to replace the old crappy ones on my Megan Street series coilovers. Here's the 2 sets springs I ended up getting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Front: 65MM(2.5\") Inner Diameter, 8k(448lbs) Spring Rate, 178mm(7\") Length</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rear: 65mm(2.5\") Innder Diameter, 6k(336lbs) Spring Rate, 203mm(8\") Length</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere's a quick before shot when I got started replacing them.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6381\" title=\"swift_f1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGot the coil all dissassembled\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/disassemble.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6377\" title=\"disassemble\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/disassemble.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow, here's another piece that ken helped me out on. As you can see from the picture above, the collar that the spring rests on, has this stupid little plastic washer. Ken reccomended I change them out to some thrust bearings. This will enabled the coil to spin freely under compression. Since what you don't want is the spring to compress, then get binded on that plastic washer while still trying to compress.I was able to pick them up for $25 bucks a piece <a href=\"http://www.summitracing.com/parts/HAL-7888-109/\">here</a> from Summit Racing and they're 65mm(2.5\") for the inner diameter. 1 Quantity is basically 2 thrust bearings, and 4 washers. So you'd need one for each corner of the car.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/thrust_bearings.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6374\" title=\"thrust_bearings\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/thrust_bearings.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick shot of everything together in the front.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6384\" title=\"swift_f2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_f2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou can really tell how much of a difference the thurst bearings make since the spring is able to freely spin now. It's also important to note where the perch was at before doing this. you don't want to have all this extra room or looseness at the top of the spring. lol\r\n\r\nHere's a quick before shot of the rear\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6383\" title=\"swift_r1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nand the after shot of the rear\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6382\" title=\"swift_r2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/swift_r2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick comparison of the two different srings. One big thing that stands out between the two is the number of coils, coil thickness and the weight of the coils. I took both of them down to the post office to get accurately weighed. I'll list the specs here below. One thing to note, is I found out oddly enough that I actually had S14 rear springs with my megan coilovers. So, my before spring length was 220mm so the weight was vastly heavier than the swifts. I'd assume though that if the spring was 200mm it would weigh at least 3lbs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Front: Megans=2.88lbs(180mm), Swift=2.41lbs(180mm)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rear: Megans=3.58(220mm), Swift=2.5(200mm)</strong>\r\n\r\nComparison for the front springs\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/front_compare.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6376\" title=\"front_compare\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/front_compare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\nComparison of the rear springs.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rear_compare.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6379\" title=\"rear_compare\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rear_compare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOverall the feeling with these springs is a WORLD of difference. I'd highly reccomend them as an upgrade if you don't feel like shelling out 1.6k+ for upper teir coilovers. This hands down takes a set of budget coils and makes then a ton better.\r\n\r\nYou really notice it driving at around 35-45mph. The slight vibrations and small bumps are totally eliminated with the swift springs. I had my megan dampening set to 15 on both the front and rear when I tested this.\r\n\r\nOkay, that was rather long winded. Now, moving onto the corner balance. I ended up getting mine done at a place locally here in seattle called <a href=\"http://www.trulineseattle.com/\">Truline</a>. They had great customer service, guys who have experience in working with cars that have pillow ball suspension links, and aftermarket suspension. I also got my alignment, and wheel balancing done while I was there. For everything it ended up running me about $450 bucks. One cool feature they have is High-Speed balancing. It's basically where they balance the front wheels while they're still bolted to the car. I ended up doing this on the front of the car, and just a normal balance for the rear.\r\n\r\nMoving onto the alignment, yet again Ken helped me out for which specs were optimal for the S13. After checking out the Nissan Road Race forum the specs I went with are below. The amount of camber you use is totally up to the wheel setup/personal preference really. When it was all said and done,\r\n\r\n<strong>Front:</strong>\r\n<strong> Toe: 0 Degrees</strong>\r\n<strong> Caster: 7.5 Degrees</strong>\r\n<strong> Camber: 3 Degrees</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rear</strong>\r\n<strong> Toe: .2 Degrees</strong>\r\n<strong> Camber: 2.5 Degrees</strong>\r\n\r\nGoing with the smaller wheel base and setting the caster to 7.5 degrees is a noticeable difference and makes the car alot more responsive and fun to drive!\r\n\r\nMoving onto the corner balance, all I can say is WOW. They loaded the car with dead weight for the driver, and basically set the car to where weight is spread out evenly across all 4 wheels. This can change over time due to suspension, and things like the chassis flexing and bending over time(It is a 21 year old car).\r\n\r\nIn the corner the car feels alot more predicable and there's a TON more grip now then before. It's almost scary how much better the car feels now. For comparison, my buddy who owns a track prepped AE86 recently drove my car and commented on how it handled very similar in terms of response and stability while cornering.","html":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n\n<p>First off, i'd like to say Happy New Year, and hopefully this next one is better than the last for all of us.^_^ Hopefully everything had a good holidays/new year as well.

I'd assume though that if the spring was 200mm it would weigh at least 3lbs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front: Megans=2.88lbs(180mm), Swift=2.41lbs(180mm)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rear: Megans=3.58(220mm), Swift=2.5(200mm)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Comparison for the front springs</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/front_compare.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6376\" title=\"front_compare\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/front_compare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Comparison of the rear springs.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rear_compare.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6379\" title=\"rear_compare\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rear_compare.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Overall the feeling with these springs is a WORLD of difference. I'd highly reccomend them as an upgrade if you don't feel like shelling out 1.6k+ for upper teir coilovers. This hands down takes a set of budget coils and makes then a ton better.</p>\n\n<p>You really notice it driving at around 35-45mph. The slight vibrations and small bumps are totally eliminated with the swift springs. I had my megan dampening set to 15 on both the front and rear when I tested this.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, that was rather long winded. Now, moving onto the corner balance. I ended up getting mine done at a place locally here in seattle called <a href=\"http://www.trulineseattle.com/\">Truline</a>. They had great customer service, guys who have experience in working with cars that have pillow ball suspension links, and aftermarket suspension. I also got my alignment, and wheel balancing done while I was there. For everything it ended up running me about $450 bucks. One cool feature they have is High-Speed balancing. It's basically where they balance the front wheels while they're still bolted to the car. I ended up doing this on the front of the car, and just a normal balance for the rear.</p>\n\n<p>Moving onto the alignment, yet again Ken helped me out for which specs were optimal for the S13. After checking out the Nissan Road Race forum the specs I went with are below. The amount of camber you use is totally up to the wheel setup/personal preference really. When it was all said and done,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Front:</strong> <br />\n<strong> Toe: 0 Degrees</strong> <br />\n<strong> Caster: 7.5 Degrees</strong> <br />\n<strong> Camber: 3 Degrees</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rear</strong> <br />\n<strong> Toe: .2 Degrees</strong> <br />\n<strong> Camber: 2.5 Degrees</strong></p>\n\n<p>Going with the smaller wheel base and setting the caster to 7.5 degrees is a noticeable difference and makes the car alot more responsive and fun to drive!</p>\n\n<p>Moving onto the corner balance, all I can say is WOW. They loaded the car with dead weight for the driver, and basically set the car to where weight is spread out evenly across all 4 wheels. This can change over time due to suspension, and things like the chassis flexing and bending over time(It is a 21 year old car).</p>\n\n<p>In the corner the car feels alot more predicable and there's a TON more grip now then before. It's almost scary how much better the car feels now. For comparison, my buddy who owns a track prepped AE86 recently drove my car and commented on how it handled very similar in terms of response and stability while cornering.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1325522209000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1406551377000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1325522209000,"published_by":1},{"id":1805,"uuid":"bd6d9a10-2c8d-4052-93cc-2b8493c222e3","title":"Yuki: Featured on Speedhunters!?","slug":"yuki-featured-on-speedhunters","markdown":"Hey guys,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to make a quick post that Yuki got featured over on Speedhunters for their Reader's Rides section because it was 1/3.

Having to meet my friend Eichi up at the Shin-Maebashi station in Gunma around 10am required me to getup around 5am, and get on the train by 6 to beat the morning rush.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0233.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7267\" title=\"IMG_0233\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0233-e1337765200480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSpotted this AKB48 store while at the station in Harajuku. Funny story actually as to why I had to stop there instead of continuing on towards gunma....\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7273\" title=\"IMG_0239\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239-e1337766525922.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI forgot this little guy. My present for Eichi which was smoked salmon. haha It didn't hit me until I had gotten to the Harajuku station, so I had to get off the train, and go back for it. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7280\" title=\"gunma_train_route\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"319\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter that, more chaos ensued at Omiya station north of tokyo.(top middle in the image) I had a little bit of trouble trying to figure out which train I needed to take because the line for Orange colored trains went into two opposite directions. My final destination was Shim-Maebashi station. After missing the first train in the proper direction, I figured out what was going on, and managed to get on the right one. I'll post about my route below:\r\n\r\nJR Yamanote Line(Light Green): Meguro -&gt; Ikebukuro\r\n\r\nJR Saikyo Line(Turqoise): Ikebukuro -&gt; Omiya\r\n\r\nJR Takasaki Line (Orange): Omiya -&gt; Takasaki\r\n\r\nJR Takasaki Line (Orange): Takaksaki-&gt; Shim-Maebashi\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7274\" title=\"IMG_0240\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in Maebashi, Eichi was waiting for me with his blue Mazda RX-7(FD3s). This is his personal car, and also doubles as a shop car featuring all parts from his shop <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CompleteGarage.ReSanai\">Complete Garage Re-Sanai</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7130\" title=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFirst task of the day was to head over to the shop, and check out all the awesome rotary goodness.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7141\" title=\"DSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nInside the shop I was greeted with a surprise! Their Time Attack car driven at Tsukuba Circuit by none other than Tarzan Yamada himself. If I remember correctly, Eichi said it did a time of 58 seconds and had about 600hp.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7167\" title=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of shooting, we grabbed some drinks from this cool shop owned vending machine. It seems to not like foreigners though since we put in 150Yen($1 USD), and instead of giving a lemon drink, it gave us Mello Yello which was about 30yen cheaper.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7169\" title=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWondering why it decided to steal money, Eichi called up the Vendor to get them to come out and fix it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7148\" title=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the maintenance guy to show up, I went and took a few more shots\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7181\" title=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter about 10-15 minute, this guy showed up to fix the machine, and give us our money back. Which I thought was really nice.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7188\" title=\"DSC_0080\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter closing up the shop, we headed over to meetup with Eichi's friend Terushige(Teru for short). At that same time, the handle seemed to had broken on the FD..:( and his window also doesn't work, so he can't jump in Nascar style either.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7187\" title=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLuckily, Teru had some tools stashed away in his Curren and helped fix the cable in the FD's door. It's also worth noting that the Curren has the same platform as the GT-Four Celica, except its FF, and has a slightly different look to it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7200\" title=\"DSC_0094\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the door issue, we headed over to a Pudding/Dessert Cafe called <a href=\"http://www.crayon2007.com/index.htm\">Crayon</a>. Apparently I was the first foreigner ever to set foot in the place, which was kind of cool. haha Eichi then introduced me to the owner Okada-san, and said he also drove a RX-7. Interested I asked \"what does it look like.\" well, a short walk around the side of the shop answered that question.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7204\" title=\"DSC_0102\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe person in black in the background is Okada-san, and this is his 800hp touge attacking machine. When I asked him if he drives this at the circuit, he simple replied \"no, only on the touge.\"..0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7202\" title=\"DSC_0099\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were two things that really stood out to me about this car(other than the 800hp). This awesome Carbon Drag style wing was one of them\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7205\" title=\"DSC_0105\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe second thing, was this GIGANTIC turbo. haha that pretty much explained the 800hp. The inlet on that thing was bigger than my entire fist!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7210\" title=\"DSC_0112\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOkada-san had one last surprise for us before we left. A Shiny new 2011 Nissan GTR! ^_^ While it was stock, it still looked super nice. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7276\" title=\"IMG_0242\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242-e1337769730460.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7277\" title=\"IMG_0243\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting Okada-san and his awesome cars, we got some lunch. I had Katsudon with some cold soba noodles and dipping sauce which was actually alot of food for only 880Yen!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7214\" title=\"DSC_0117\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Eichi and I headed up to the legendary Mt.Haruna(Akina) which was roughly 30 minutes away. It looks EXACTLY like is does in the anime, even the water tower behind us is the same. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7222\" title=\"DSC_0127\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI took a couple more fancy pics of the rx-7, before heading to another familiar place....\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7236\" title=\"DSC_0141\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYup, that's right. Lake Haruna(Akina)!! ^_^\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7239\" title=\"DSC_0144\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Lighting here was really odd because it would go from light to dark every couple minutes. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7252\" title=\"DSC_0170\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs we were leaving I took a couple more pictures, and its sort of hard to see here, but there were black doughnut circles all over the place from people coming here at night and playing around drifting and doing doughnuts. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7262\" title=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLater that night, after we got back to Eichi's place, Teru-san stopped by with a surprise, His Rx-7! this one, like eichi's was running a 13BT, and had about 1.4bar(17 psi) of boost making about 400hp.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7279\" title=\"IMG_0246\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246-e1337770848178.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs we were sitting at Eichi's place talking with Taru, he got a message from his friend that she was making Korean food and hanging out with some of his other friends and girlfriend, and invited us to come try some. So we headed over to a bar/lounge called Clover that one of the friends owns. After talking to them, they were all really nice, and surprised I came to Gunma all the way from Seattle. oh and also that I spoke japanese. haha The food above is Called bibimbap, and it was rice with hamburger, egg, onions, and some other misc stuff. It was really good, and I actually couldn't eat all of it, since I was still full from having a late lunch.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7278\" title=\"IMG_0245\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also had a Super Famicom there as well, with a bunch of games including Rockman. lol After eating and talking for a bit, we realized it was already 11pm. Since we had to getup around 4am to get started on going to ebisu circuit in the morning.

Funny story actually as to why I had to stop there instead of continuing on towards gunma....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7273\" title=\"IMG_0239\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0239-e1337766525922.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I forgot this little guy. My present for Eichi which was smoked salmon. haha It didn't hit me until I had gotten to the Harajuku station, so I had to get off the train, and go back for it. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7280\" title=\"gunma_train_route\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gunma_train_route.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"319\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After that, more chaos ensued at Omiya station north of tokyo.(top middle in the image) I had a little bit of trouble trying to figure out which train I needed to take because the line for Orange colored trains went into two opposite directions. My final destination was Shim-Maebashi station. After missing the first train in the proper direction, I figured out what was going on, and managed to get on the right one. I'll post about my route below:</p>\n\n<p>JR Yamanote Line(Light Green): Meguro -&gt; Ikebukuro</p>\n\n<p>JR Saikyo Line(Turqoise): Ikebukuro -&gt; Omiya</p>\n\n<p>JR Takasaki Line (Orange): Omiya -&gt; Takasaki</p>\n\n<p>JR Takasaki Line (Orange): Takaksaki-&gt; Shim-Maebashi</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7274\" title=\"IMG_0240\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0240.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After arriving in Maebashi, Eichi was waiting for me with his blue Mazda RX-7(FD3s). This is his personal car, and also doubles as a shop car featuring all parts from his shop <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CompleteGarage.ReSanai\">Complete Garage Re-Sanai</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7130\" title=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>First task of the day was to head over to the shop, and check out all the awesome rotary goodness.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7141\" title=\"DSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0014.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Inside the shop I was greeted with a surprise! Their Time Attack car driven at Tsukuba Circuit by none other than Tarzan Yamada himself. If I remember correctly, Eichi said it did a time of 58 seconds and had about 600hp.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7167\" title=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0049.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After a bit of shooting, we grabbed some drinks from this cool shop owned vending machine. It seems to not like foreigners though since we put in 150Yen($1 USD), and instead of giving a lemon drink, it gave us Mello Yello which was about 30yen cheaper.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7169\" title=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0051.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Wondering why it decided to steal money, Eichi called up the Vendor to get them to come out and fix it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7148\" title=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While waiting for the maintenance guy to show up, I went and took a few more shots</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7181\" title=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0068.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After about 10-15 minute, this guy showed up to fix the machine, and give us our money back. Which I thought was really nice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7188\" title=\"DSC_0080\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After closing up the shop, we headed over to meetup with Eichi's friend Terushige(Teru for short). At that same time, the handle seemed to had broken on the FD..:( and his window also doesn't work, so he can't jump in Nascar style either.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7187\" title=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0079.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Luckily, Teru had some tools stashed away in his Curren and helped fix the cable in the FD's door. It's also worth noting that the Curren has the same platform as the GT-Four Celica, except its FF, and has a slightly different look to it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7200\" title=\"DSC_0094\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0094.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After fixing the door issue, we headed over to a Pudding/Dessert Cafe called <a href=\"http://www.crayon2007.com/index.htm\">Crayon</a>. Apparently I was the first foreigner ever to set foot in the place, which was kind of cool. haha Eichi then introduced me to the owner Okada-san, and said he also drove a RX-7. Interested I asked \"what does it look like.\" well, a short walk around the side of the shop answered that question.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7204\" title=\"DSC_0102\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0102.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The person in black in the background is Okada-san, and this is his 800hp touge attacking machine. When I asked him if he drives this at the circuit, he simple replied \"no, only on the touge.\"..0_o</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7202\" title=\"DSC_0099\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0099.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There were two things that really stood out to me about this car(other than the 800hp). This awesome Carbon Drag style wing was one of them</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7205\" title=\"DSC_0105\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0105.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The second thing, was this GIGANTIC turbo. haha that pretty much explained the 800hp. The inlet on that thing was bigger than my entire fist!!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7210\" title=\"DSC_0112\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Okada-san had one last surprise for us before we left. A Shiny new 2011 Nissan GTR! ^_^ While it was stock, it still looked super nice. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7276\" title=\"IMG_0242\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0242-e1337769730460.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7277\" title=\"IMG_0243\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0243.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After the meeting Okada-san and his awesome cars, we got some lunch. I had Katsudon with some cold soba noodles and dipping sauce which was actually alot of food for only 880Yen!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7214\" title=\"DSC_0117\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0117.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After lunch Eichi and I headed up to the legendary Mt.Haruna(Akina) which was roughly 30 minutes away. It looks EXACTLY like is does in the anime, even the water tower behind us is the same. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7222\" title=\"DSC_0127\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I took a couple more fancy pics of the rx-7, before heading to another familiar place....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7236\" title=\"DSC_0141\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0141.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Yup, that's right. Lake Haruna(Akina)!! ^_^</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7239\" title=\"DSC_0144\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0144.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The Lighting here was really odd because it would go from light to dark every couple minutes. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7252\" title=\"DSC_0170\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As we were leaving I took a couple more pictures, and its sort of hard to see here, but there were black doughnut circles all over the place from people coming here at night and playing around drifting and doing doughnuts. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7262\" title=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Later that night, after we got back to Eichi's place, Teru-san stopped by with a surprise, His Rx-7! this one, like eichi's was running a 13BT, and had about 1.4bar(17 psi) of boost making about 400hp.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7279\" title=\"IMG_0246\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0246-e1337770848178.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As we were sitting at Eichi's place talking with Taru, he got a message from his friend that she was making Korean food and hanging out with some of his other friends and girlfriend, and invited us to come try some. So we headed over to a bar/lounge called Clover that one of the friends owns. After talking to them, they were all really nice, and surprised I came to Gunma all the way from Seattle. oh and also that I spoke japanese. haha The food above is Called bibimbap, and it was rice with hamburger, egg, onions, and some other misc stuff. It was really good, and I actually couldn't eat all of it, since I was still full from having a late lunch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7278\" title=\"IMG_0245\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0245.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They also had a Super Famicom there as well, with a bunch of games including Rockman. lol After eating and talking for a bit, we realized it was already 11pm. Since we had to getup around 4am to get started on going to ebisu circuit in the morning. We decided to call it a night, and get some sleep.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"4\" orderby=\"post_date\"]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1337746496000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719444000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1337746496000,"published_by":1},{"id":1811,"uuid":"4d356eca-1131-47e7-9e0f-78526a53c44a","title":"Japan Trip: Day 3 (Team Orange Drift School @ Ebisu Circuit)","slug":"japan-trip-day-3team-orange-drift-school-ebisu-circuit","markdown":"For Day 3 of my trip, Luckily I was able to save up some money, and also get some help to attend the Team Orange Drift School at Ebisu Circuit!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00301.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7315\" title=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00301.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0002.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7293\" title=\"DSC_0002\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEichi and I got up around 4am, and headed out to Fukushima prefecture around 5.

I got this specific model for 2 reasons. One being that is the ONLY harness on the market that’s DOT approved and legal. The second reason I got this harness was because unlike others, this one can be mounted to the rear seat belt points.

I got this specific model for 2 reasons. One being that is the ONLY harness on the market that’s DOT approved and legal. The second reason I got this harness was because unlike others, this one can be mounted to the rear seat belt points. Usually, if you mount them there, its beyond a 45 degree angle and can lead to nasty things like spinal compression in the event of an accident.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110726_154514.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"IMG_20110726_154514\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_20110726_154514\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110726_154514.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>  <p>I’ll be sure to get some more pics of them actually installed along with my shift knob. <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout\" alt=\"Smile with tongue out\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png\" /> I’ve just been lazy. hehe</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110725_215707.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"IMG_20110725_215707\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_20110725_215707\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110725_215707.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s a circuit sports coolant reservoir I got recently as well. lol</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_222521.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"IMG_20110813_222521\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_20110813_222521\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_222521.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>  <p>Last but not least, the MOST IMPORTANT upgrade of them all is the Yuki sweatband!! haha</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_220547.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"IMG_20110813_220547\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_20110813_220547\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_220547.jpg\" width=\"377\" height=\"504\" /></a></p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_2225291.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"IMG_20110813_222529\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_20110813_222529\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_20110813_222529.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"377\" /></a></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1315597746000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1406551377000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1315597746000,"published_by":1},{"id":1814,"uuid":"addc27af-ce9e-4f58-aec7-d63988838d41","title":"Japan Trip: Day 6 (Tonchan and Shinjuku)","slug":"japan-trip-day-6-tonchan-and-shinjuku","markdown":"so, today I was feeling a bit lazy, and didn't feel like venture out anywhere really.

lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7504\" title=\"DSC_0026\" alt=\"\"

corner.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00323.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7508\" title=\"DSC_0032\" alt=\"\"

wall, and a crank, some rods and pistons encased there in plexiglass.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00451.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large

well\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00473.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7523\" title=\"DSC_0047\" alt=\"\"

trying to drive this and focus on everything else. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00612.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7534\"

designed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00592.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7532\" title=\"DSC_0059\" alt=\"\"

The far left one was actually Sea Urchin, and tasted really good! The stuff on the far right is egg FYI.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7670\" title=\"DSC_0102\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01021.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis clean NSX was spotted on our way going to the Skytree.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01112.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7675\" title=\"DSC_0111\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01112.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe giant golden thingy is a flame and apparently used to stand straight up, but cops thought it looked too much like poo, so they asked the owners of the building to turn it on its side.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01271.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7684\" title=\"DSC_0127\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01271.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce we got to the sky tree area they had this cool little Studio Ghibli shop.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01281.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7685\" title=\"DSC_0128\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01281.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSkytree! it's about 2,080 feet tall.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01381.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7694\" title=\"DSC_0138\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01381.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also felt the need to take a picture of this guys' awesome photographers pose while trying to take a picture of the skytree.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0146.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7700\" title=\"DSC_0146\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0146.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThese water bottles are pretty cool. they're recyclable, and are able to shrink down by crumpling it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0159.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7705\" title=\"DSC_0159\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0159.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext stop after the skytree was asakusa. This temple apparently was build around 650ad\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01541.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7703\" title=\"DSC_0154\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01541.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\noh yeah, newsflash, there's a crap ton of people in tokyo!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0180.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7722\" title=\"DSC_0180\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0180.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext stop after Asakusa was Akihabara. I'll be going there again later in the week, so more pictures will come then as well. This place has a Cafe and gift shop for an all girl pop group called AKB48.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01811.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7723\" title=\"DSC_0181\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01811.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext to the ABK48 cafe/shop was the Gundam Cafe!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01851.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7726\" title=\"DSC_0185\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01851.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis rx-8 was chillin outside, and had a nice sounding exhaust note.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01902.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7730\" title=\"DSC_0190\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01902.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOutside there was this mini-statue that said \"please don't touch\", but these guys thought it'd be funny to mess with the gundam to make him give everyone the finger. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0193.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7733\" title=\"DSC_0193\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0193.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nhere's a quick shot of the inside.

This one is a Nissan S15 and was running stock boost, with a Trust turbo. I forget the specific model, but it was still a bottom mount though. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7773\" title=\"DSC_0243\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02431.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI forget this guys' name. But, after talking with him about his s15, and showing him my S13 I realized something. In the US, if you take pics of somebody's car, and try to go talk to them, Half the time, the owner won't be very friendly, and start mean mugging you. However, in japan, people are very nice and don't mind talking about stuff.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7780\" title=\"DSC_0251\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRan into another Nissan Itasha. This one is a Kouki S14, but the owner was nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7788\" title=\"DSC_0261\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nUp on the surface, This Toyota Chaser was spotted!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0265.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7790\" title=\"DSC_0265\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0265.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOf course what akihabara trip would be complete without meido! ^_^ I'll be going back here again to find a tsundere maid cafe, so I'll have more pics in a few days. For now, check the gallery for others.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0273.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7795\" title=\"DSC_0273\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0273.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the station, I ran into another rx-8.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0284.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7482\" title=\"aIMG_0284\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0284.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter Akiba, Matsumoto-san took me to this place that had Tsukemen Ramen.

But, after talking with him about his s15, and showing him my S13 I realized something. In the US, if you take pics of somebody's car, and try to go talk to them, Half the time, the owner won't be very friendly, and start mean mugging you. However, in japan, people are very nice and don't mind talking about stuff.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7780\" title=\"DSC_0251\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0251.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Ran into another Nissan Itasha.

Sadly, the rental place had disabled the switches to turn off annoying driver aids like TCS(traction control). So, it was a bit hard to have dori action or do doughnuts with it, but still a very fun car overall. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8067\" title=\"DSC_0003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00033.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that really tripped me out while driving is these style traffic lights. This one basically means you can turn left, and go straight, but not turn right. the light will change to yellow, then go back to red, and a green right arrow will appear.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00083.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8070\" title=\"DSC_0008\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00083.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our way to Fuji we ran into this Chevy shop called <a href=\"http://marcelo.co.jp\">Marcelo</a> in Yokohama.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00103.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8072\" title=\"DSC_0010\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00103-e1338254479940.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis corvette had some aweosome pearl flakes in it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00193.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8079\" title=\"DSC_0019\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00193.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDerek tryin to act like a baws with some glasses he found under the hood of this camaro. This was on a sunday, so the shop was all closed up. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8080\" title=\"DSC_0020\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLastly there was an awesome Dodge Challenger R/T sitting there with a nice purple paint job.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8082\" title=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs we were heading to the freeway, we spotted this slammed VIP Honda Odyssey.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8091\" title=\"DSC_0037\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter driving about an hour, and completely missing our exit, we decided to make a quick stop in this PA. Luckily we did, because an older guy pulled up in his brand new Subaru BRZ!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8095\" title=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe finally arrived at Fuji and decided to grab some lunch at this supermarket before hitting the touge. After we came out, there was this clean Celica sitting next to us with Speedline wheels, and some wierd clear gascap thingy. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8061\" title=\"aIMG_0286\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286-e1338255236165.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLunch for the day consisted of Pizza with corn on it, which actually wasn't too bad!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8105\" title=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breaking for lunch, we ran into yet another surprise. This tiny little drift shop called Auto Garage Replica.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8110\" title=\"DSC_0064\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt the time, these guys were working on this S15, and the rx-7 there in the background.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8100\" title=\"DSC_0054\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis NSX Type-R was tucked away in the corner. I wanted it SOOO BAD!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8102\" title=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis tuned kei car seemed a bit out of place here at this drift shop. I Believe it was a Nissan March.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8103\" title=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis March was no joke either, it was a fully gutted racecar. Why? well..because RACECAR of course.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8122\" title=\"DSC_0076\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTime do DO WORK on Ashigara Pass!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8125\" title=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe road start off super narrow. so ontop of adjusting driving RHD and this being a bigger car than what i'm used to, it was a bit difficult to go balls to the wall knowing there's bikers n whatnot around.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8131\" title=\"DSC_0085\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSome evidence of late night drift action!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8139\" title=\"DSC_0093\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI managed to take home a piece of tailight that somebody left behind from trying to get a super entry drift, and losing a fight with the gaurdrail. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8142\" title=\"DSC_0096\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nnaturally there were pieces of rubber, and chunks lining the outside of the road here. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8145\" title=\"DSC_0100\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe view of Mt. Fuji here was really cool. It was a bit sad, that because of the humidity, you couldn't see everything as clear as it would be back in Washington State.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8170\" title=\"DSC_0129\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce we got to the top, we ran into this guy who was cruising on a little Honda Baja 50cc bike. Uphill he said its a nightmare, but downhill is lots of fun. Turns out this guy is a Prototype Engineer at Nissan. We tried to get him to spill the beans on the S16 Silvia, but all he could say is \"maybe\" with a wry smile. So, something tells me that there's one coming ;) I Believe his name was Hanataro, but i could be wrong. Its hard to remember names for me for some reason. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8172\" title=\"DSC_0131\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter some Touge we originally, had planned to go to Fuji-Q Highland to check out the Evangelion World exhibit. However, we ran into this awesome kart track called <a href=\"http://www.apg-kart.com/\">APG(Auto Paradise Gotenba</a>) on the way there, and decided to stop and take a quick peek.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8178\" title=\"DSC_0139\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt looked like we had just came in while they had a qualifying session underway. Most of the kids driving seemed to be from ages 7-12 or so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8179\" title=\"DSC_0148\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\neven though these kids were young, they were hauling around this track.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8191\" title=\"DSC_0183\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThese kids had some really nice lines, and a couple really good passes in the braking zones like pictured above.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8185\" title=\"DSC_0164\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe noticed this stack of rental cars chilling in one of the bays. So, we went down to ask the manager if it was possible to rent them. Turns out it was, but only from 4:30-5:30 that day. It was roughly 3pm when we check the time. We then asked him \"how long does it take to get to Fuji-Q Highland?\". His response was about 45 minutes. Then, we asked \"well, what about fuji speedway?\". This answer of 15 minutes we liked a bit more. There was a ton of traffic during the day however, so we weren't quite sure of 15 minutes was accurate.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8197\" title=\"DSC_0201\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe manager (who's name escapes me) was nice enough to draw us a map of a shortcut on how to get to fuji. APG is where we were at, and the circled blip at the top is fuji speedway. oh, and the swastica symbol in japan is actually used to Temples.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8200\" title=\"DSC_0206\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe decided to pull into the entrance to the template for a couple quick photo's. We didn't go all the way inside, but from the super long entrance road, it probably was pretty big.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8203\" title=\"DSC_0213\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fsw.tv/english/\">Fuji Speedway!</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8205\" title=\"DSC_0216\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAccording to Derek, you normally have to pay an entrance fee at the gate just to get in. However, this was a Sunday and for some reason, nobody was at the gate. So, we were able to drive right in, and head up to the grandstands without anybody saying anything. lol This is one of the cool things I like when compared to US tracks. Ones here, are just open for anybody that want to use them, even worldwide known ones like Fuji Speedway.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8207\" title=\"DSC_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere a surprise about this Levin a bit later in the post....^_^\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8209\" title=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSome guys working on a Ferrari racecar checking tire pressure or temp I assume.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8212\" title=\"DSC_0230\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere there's a NSX making mince-meat out of a nissan kei car,and hunting down what looks to be a Porsche 911.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8230\" title=\"DSC_0333\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nnice rear end shot of that Ferrari.

Also, here in the corner is that red Levin I mentioned earlier.

It's pretty standard, but still clean at the same time. This car sees double duty as a drift car, and a grip car.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0436.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8271\" title=\"DSC_0436\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0436.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe owner of this little Levin(nicknamed Anna) is Miura-san of Garage Miura from down in Shizuoka. Why is this guy so cool might you ask? It's just an ordinary levin with a standard 4age right? well....\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0454.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8286\" title=\"DSC_0454\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0454.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe asked if it was possible to get a ride along in his car, but he replied saying that the track time for his session is already over. But, he said we can go around on the outskirts of the track and have a bit of fun. I  was already super pumped about being able to ride in it, when he said \"do you wanna drive?\" I was completely dumbfounded that he would let some random foreigner from Seattle drive his car. After babying it around a few corners, he said \"you can revv it up to 8k rpms\". so, on one of the straights, I Really got on it, and man this car sounded amazing! It had dual 40mm carbs on it, so the response was great!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8294\" title=\"DSC_0464\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMe trying to explain that 86's in the US are expensive as hell, and Miura-san responding with \"oh, I only paid $300 for mine stock.\" I wish deals were like that in the US. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8291\" title=\"DSC_0461\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA quick picture with Miura-san again before heading back out to the Karting track!

So, I think if I had a bit more experience with this track I might be able to shave another second off. One thing that was fun, is these were the fastest karts i've driven yet, so flying into the first corner was a ton of fun. lol Also, I believe the manager's name is written there to the left. so, if anyone could translate that kanji for me it'd be appreciated! ^_^ It's worth noting some of those custom karts from earler were getting times in the 44 second range. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0475.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8303\" title=\"DSC_0475\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nquick photo before we leave of Derek, the manager, and myself. He was really nice, and when I asked him about my lap times he said, they were okay. haha personally I thought they were pretty damn good for being in a rental, and never driven the course before. I actually ended up lapping Derek, although he spun on the corner as I was coming up to challenge him. maybe next time we'll be able to have more of a battle! haha ;)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0480.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8306\" title=\"DSC_0480\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext stop for the day was Fuji-Q Highland! there was one problem though, apparently the park seemed to be closed. The entrance was wide open though, so we walked in to take a look and try to find Evangelion World.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8310\" title=\"DSC_0485\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlong the way we found this cool Hamtaro boat ride. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8315\" title=\"DSC_0492\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe finally made it to our destination! but, as we feared it was already closed! :( my buddy mike was really looking forward to pics from this, so I felt kinda bad. But, I made it up to him by getting some awesome stuff the following day at the Toyota History Garage. So, look for that a bit later. ;)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0515.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8338\" title=\"DSC_0515\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0515.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter some walking around to check out other closed down attractions, we headed back to the exit. Except there was one problem....we somehow got locked in! 0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0519.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8340\" title=\"DSC_0519\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0519.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSo, we had to resort to using our old school playground skills to escape. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0520.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8341\" title=\"DSC_0520\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0520.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nhere you can see our lone 370Z chillin in the parking lot. We were pretty much done in the Fuji area, and proceeded to go find some food, before going back to the Yokohama area for one last stop.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8064\" title=\"aIMG_0292\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe decided to hitup this mcdonalds by the freeway and surprisingly, after about 8 days in japan, this was my first time finally going there. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8063\" title=\"aIMG_0290\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI ended up ordering Large size for everything, since it seems mcdonalds in Japan is basically a step down from what we have in the US. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8344\" title=\"DSC_0523\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhen we were leaving to go back to Yokohama this Subaru Rally car was chillin outside. Its funny how often you run into awesome cars over here compared to in the US.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0548.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8355\" title=\"DSC_0548\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOur final stop for the day was the legendary Daikokufuto PA just across the Rainbow Bay Bridge. While I didn't get any pics of the bridge, Derek got some video footage of my driving over it, so I'll upload that and link to it here in a bit. Just look for the video link at the bottom of the post!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8360\" title=\"DSC_0555\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs as were walking around this super loud Wangan tunes 86 showed up. You can tell he's serious by all the crazy functional aero stuff he has done to the car. especially the splitters on the top of the door. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8364\" title=\"DSC_0561\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere you can see more crazy aero with his front canards, and splitter. All these parts are one-off, and he showed us some video on his phone of him driving the C1 Loop. All I can say, is this dude has balls of steel! Driving this car at 200km/h+ would scare the crap out of me. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8374\" title=\"DSC_0576\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe next car we ran into was this super clean Hakousuka Skyline! We went and talked to the owner, and asked him to open the hood to see what was inside, since it didn't sound quite right.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8390\" title=\"DSC_0596\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo our surprise it had a L28 from the Datsun/Nissan 240z, except this specific one had been over bored to make it an L30 which 3 Litres of awesome-ness!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8387\" title=\"DSC_0590\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere we were talking to the owner of this nice looking Toyota Altezza who says he's making about 450hp on 1.4 bar of boost which is about 20psi or so.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8386\" title=\"DSC_0589\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a better close-up of the Beams 3SGTE motor running a Trust turbo, but I forget which specific model. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8389\" title=\"DSC_0593\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI never noticed how cool the tach on these altezzas looked. I'm not sure of this one, is specific only to japan, but I really liked how the overall speed was in the center, with smaller gauges inside, and rpm off to the side there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8393\" title=\"DSC_0601\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSince it was already a bit late, and all the trains stopped running at midnight, we had to book it out of there, to make my trains in Yokohama. I wanna give a huge thanks to Derek for showing me around all over the place, and renting the 370Z for the day!\r\n\r\nI've got video from this day, so I'll sort through it and get it uploaded a it later. so sit tight for now on that. :p\r\n\r\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"4\" orderby=\"post_date\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>So, for day 8 my friend Derek from <a href=\"http://pacificcoastjdm.com/\">Pacific Coast Auto Imports</a> was nice enough to rent a 370Z for us to take out to the Mt.Fuji area and do some exploring/touge runs!

This was on a sunday, so the shop was all closed up. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8080\" title=\"DSC_0020\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00203.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Lastly there was an awesome Dodge Challenger R/T sitting there with a nice purple paint job.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8082\" title=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00224.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As we were heading to the freeway, we spotted this slammed VIP Honda Odyssey.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8091\" title=\"DSC_0037\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00372.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After driving about an hour, and completely missing our exit, we decided to make a quick stop in this PA. Luckily we did, because an older guy pulled up in his brand new Subaru BRZ!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8095\" title=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00483.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We finally arrived at Fuji and decided to grab some lunch at this supermarket before hitting the touge. After we came out, there was this clean Celica sitting next to us with Speedline wheels, and some wierd clear gascap thingy. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8061\" title=\"aIMG_0286\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0286-e1338255236165.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Lunch for the day consisted of Pizza with corn on it, which actually wasn't too bad!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8105\" title=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After breaking for lunch, we ran into yet another surprise. This tiny little drift shop called Auto Garage Replica.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8110\" title=\"DSC_0064\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00643.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At the time, these guys were working on this S15, and the rx-7 there in the background.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8100\" title=\"DSC_0054\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00543.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This NSX Type-R was tucked away in the corner. I wanted it SOOO BAD!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8102\" title=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This tuned kei car seemed a bit out of place here at this drift shop. I Believe it was a Nissan March.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8103\" title=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00572.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This March was no joke either, it was a fully gutted racecar. Why? well..because RACECAR of course.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8122\" title=\"DSC_0076\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00763.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Time do DO WORK on Ashigara Pass!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8125\" title=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00792.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The road start off super narrow. so ontop of adjusting driving RHD and this being a bigger car than what i'm used to, it was a bit difficult to go balls to the wall knowing there's bikers n whatnot around.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8131\" title=\"DSC_0085\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00852.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some evidence of late night drift action!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8139\" title=\"DSC_0093\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00932.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I managed to take home a piece of tailight that somebody left behind from trying to get a super entry drift, and losing a fight with the gaurdrail. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8142\" title=\"DSC_0096\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0096.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>naturally there were pieces of rubber, and chunks lining the outside of the road here. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8145\" title=\"DSC_0100\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The view of Mt. Fuji here was really cool. It was a bit sad, that because of the humidity, you couldn't see everything as clear as it would be back in Washington State.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8170\" title=\"DSC_0129\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once we got to the top, we ran into this guy who was cruising on a little Honda Baja 50cc bike. Uphill he said its a nightmare, but downhill is lots of fun. Turns out this guy is a Prototype Engineer at Nissan. We tried to get him to spill the beans on the S16 Silvia, but all he could say is \"maybe\" with a wry smile. So, something tells me that there's one coming ;) I Believe his name was Hanataro, but i could be wrong. Its hard to remember names for me for some reason. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8172\" title=\"DSC_0131\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01312.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After some Touge we originally, had planned to go to Fuji-Q Highland to check out the Evangelion World exhibit. However, we ran into this awesome kart track called <a href=\"http://www.apg-kart.com/\">APG(Auto Paradise Gotenba</a>) on the way there, and decided to stop and take a quick peek.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8178\" title=\"DSC_0139\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01391.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It looked like we had just came in while they had a qualifying session underway. Most of the kids driving seemed to be from ages 7-12 or so.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8179\" title=\"DSC_0148\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01481.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>even though these kids were young, they were hauling around this track.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8191\" title=\"DSC_0183\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01832.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These kids had some really nice lines, and a couple really good passes in the braking zones like pictured above.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8185\" title=\"DSC_0164\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01641.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We noticed this stack of rental cars chilling in one of the bays. So, we went down to ask the manager if it was possible to rent them. Turns out it was, but only from 4:30-5:30 that day. It was roughly 3pm when we check the time. We then asked him \"how long does it take to get to Fuji-Q Highland?\". His response was about 45 minutes. Then, we asked \"well, what about fuji speedway?\". This answer of 15 minutes we liked a bit more. There was a ton of traffic during the day however, so we weren't quite sure of 15 minutes was accurate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8197\" title=\"DSC_0201\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The manager (who's name escapes me) was nice enough to draw us a map of a shortcut on how to get to fuji. APG is where we were at, and the circled blip at the top is fuji speedway. oh, and the swastica symbol in japan is actually used to Temples.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8200\" title=\"DSC_0206\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We decided to pull into the entrance to the template for a couple quick photo's. We didn't go all the way inside, but from the super long entrance road, it probably was pretty big.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8203\" title=\"DSC_0213\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fsw.tv/english/\">Fuji Speedway!</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8205\" title=\"DSC_0216\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>According to Derek, you normally have to pay an entrance fee at the gate just to get in. However, this was a Sunday and for some reason, nobody was at the gate. So, we were able to drive right in, and head up to the grandstands without anybody saying anything. lol This is one of the cool things I like when compared to US tracks. Ones here, are just open for anybody that want to use them, even worldwide known ones like Fuji Speedway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8207\" title=\"DSC_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02221.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There a surprise about this Levin a bit later in the post....^_^</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8209\" title=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02261.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some guys working on a Ferrari racecar checking tire pressure or temp I assume.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8212\" title=\"DSC_0230\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_02302.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here there's a NSX making mince-meat out of a nissan kei car,and hunting down what looks to be a Porsche 911.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8230\" title=\"DSC_0333\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0333.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>nice rear end shot of that Ferrari.

But, he said we can go around on the outskirts of the track and have a bit of fun. I  was already super pumped about being able to ride in it, when he said \"do you wanna drive?\" I was completely dumbfounded that he would let some random foreigner from Seattle drive his car. After babying it around a few corners, he said \"you can revv it up to 8k rpms\". so, on one of the straights, I Really got on it, and man this car sounded amazing! It had dual 40mm carbs on it, so the response was great!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8294\" title=\"DSC_0464\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0464.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Me trying to explain that 86's in the US are expensive as hell, and Miura-san responding with \"oh, I only paid $300 for mine stock.\" I wish deals were like that in the US. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8291\" title=\"DSC_0461\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0461.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A quick picture with Miura-san again before heading back out to the Karting track!

So, I think if I had a bit more experience with this track I might be able to shave another second off. One thing that was fun, is these were the fastest karts i've driven yet, so flying into the first corner was a ton of fun. lol Also, I believe the manager's name is written there to the left. so, if anyone could translate that kanji for me it'd be appreciated! ^_^ It's worth noting some of those custom karts from earler were getting times in the 44 second range. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0475.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8303\" title=\"DSC_0475\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>quick photo before we leave of Derek, the manager, and myself. He was really nice, and when I asked him about my lap times he said, they were okay. haha personally I thought they were pretty damn good for being in a rental, and never driven the course before. I actually ended up lapping Derek, although he spun on the corner as I was coming up to challenge him. maybe next time we'll be able to have more of a battle! haha ;)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0480.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8306\" title=\"DSC_0480\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0480.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Next stop for the day was Fuji-Q Highland! there was one problem though, apparently the park seemed to be closed. The entrance was wide open though, so we walked in to take a look and try to find Evangelion World.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8310\" title=\"DSC_0485\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Along the way we found this cool Hamtaro boat ride. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8315\" title=\"DSC_0492\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0492.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We finally made it to our destination! but, as we feared it was already closed! :( my buddy mike was really looking forward to pics from this, so I felt kinda bad. But, I made it up to him by getting some awesome stuff the following day at the Toyota History Garage. So, look for that a bit later. ;)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0515.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8338\" title=\"DSC_0515\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0515.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After some walking around to check out other closed down attractions, we headed back to the exit.

We were pretty much done in the Fuji area, and proceeded to go find some food, before going back to the Yokohama area for one last stop.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8064\" title=\"aIMG_0292\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We decided to hitup this mcdonalds by the freeway and surprisingly, after about 8 days in japan, this was my first time finally going there. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8063\" title=\"aIMG_0290\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0290.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I ended up ordering Large size for everything, since it seems mcdonalds in Japan is basically a step down from what we have in the US. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8344\" title=\"DSC_0523\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0523.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When we were leaving to go back to Yokohama this Subaru Rally car was chillin outside. Its funny how often you run into awesome cars over here compared to in the US.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0548.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8355\" title=\"DSC_0548\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Our final stop for the day was the legendary Daikokufuto PA just across the Rainbow Bay Bridge. While I didn't get any pics of the bridge, Derek got some video footage of my driving over it, so I'll upload that and link to it here in a bit. Just look for the video link at the bottom of the post!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8360\" title=\"DSC_0555\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0555.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As as were walking around this super loud Wangan tunes 86 showed up. You can tell he's serious by all the crazy functional aero stuff he has done to the car. especially the splitters on the top of the door. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8364\" title=\"DSC_0561\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0561.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here you can see more crazy aero with his front canards, and splitter. All these parts are one-off, and he showed us some video on his phone of him driving the C1 Loop. All I can say, is this dude has balls of steel! Driving this car at 200km/h+ would scare the crap out of me. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8374\" title=\"DSC_0576\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The next car we ran into was this super clean Hakousuka Skyline! We went and talked to the owner, and asked him to open the hood to see what was inside, since it didn't sound quite right.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8390\" title=\"DSC_0596\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0596.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To our surprise it had a L28 from the Datsun/Nissan 240z, except this specific one had been over bored to make it an L30 which 3 Litres of awesome-ness!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8387\" title=\"DSC_0590\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0590.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here we were talking to the owner of this nice looking Toyota Altezza who says he's making about 450hp on 1.4 bar of boost which is about 20psi or so.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8386\" title=\"DSC_0589\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0589.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a better close-up of the Beams 3SGTE motor running a Trust turbo, but I forget which specific model. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8389\" title=\"DSC_0593\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0593.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I never noticed how cool the tach on these altezzas looked. I'm not sure of this one, is specific only to japan, but I really liked how the overall speed was in the center, with smaller gauges inside, and rpm off to the side there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8393\" title=\"DSC_0601\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Since it was already a bit late, and all the trains stopped running at midnight, we had to book it out of there, to make my trains in Yokohama. I wanna give a huge thanks to Derek for showing me around all over the place, and renting the 370Z for the day!</p>\n\n<p>I've got video from this day, so I'll sort through it and get it uploaded a it later. so sit tight for now on that. :p</p>\n\n<p>[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"4\" orderby=\"post_date\"]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1338245277000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719443000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1338245277000,"published_by":1},{"id":1817,"uuid":"f9d161bf-7d7f-4b9c-a7ee-cea7342a0182","title":"Japan Trip: Day 9 (Giant Gundam, Toyota MegaWeb and more Akihabara)","slug":"japan-trip-day-9-giant-gundam-toyota-megaweb-and-more-akihabara","markdown":"Day 9 of my trip was mostly spend hanging out with my buddy Darrick around the Odaiba area and going to Akihabara as well.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00421.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8452\" title=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00421.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0298.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8401\" title=\"aIMG_0298\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0298-e1338278958630.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFirst step of the day involved heading over to Haneda Airport to pickup my buddy Darrick.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8424\" title=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00014.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfterwards, we took the new Yurikamome across the rainbow bay bridge over to Odaiba.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00074.jpg\"><img title=\"DSC_0007\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00074.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter getting off at the right station, we decided to hunt around Aqua City for the mcdonalds and grab some lunch.

Sitting here was a Formula 1 car driven by Alan Mcnish, that look really smaller than I thought it would in person.

I took video of this for a bit, so check the link at the bottom of the post. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8519\" title=\"DSC_0123\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01232.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNext up was this completely MINT showroom Toyota Corolla Levin from 1983. words cannot begin to describe how cool of an experience this was.

We asked about testing the new 86, but it would involve waiting a solid 3-4 hours. So, we decided to go play with the display models instead. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01581.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8546\" title=\"DSC_0158\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01581.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe red one on the left was Automatic, and the Silver one to the right was Manual.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01601.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8548\" title=\"DSC_0160\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSMH, Epic Fail Toyota... you just had to put the stupid boxer motor in it....*sigh*\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01691.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8555\" title=\"DSC_0169\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01691.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis picture is misleading. While I was giving a thumbs up, I should've been giving thumbs down. While this interior does look much better than the stupid crap we're getting from the Scion FT-86. It still kinda fails with the steering wheel felling like a musting, and almost everything being covered in suede. Overall I just think that Toyota didn't listen to the right people when they were working on building this car..&gt;_&lt;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01833.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8564\" title=\"DSC_0183\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01833.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also had this cool GT5 simulator setup for people to try.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01841.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8565\" title=\"DSC_0184\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01841.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nback in another store they had some cool F1 helmets worn by Jean Alesi\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01861.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8567\" title=\"DSC_0186\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01861.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso this Personal steering wheel signed by Michael Schumacher.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01891.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8569\" title=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01891.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\na quick overview shot of the second building which was called Toyota MegaWeb.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01992.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8578\" title=\"DSC_0199\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_01992.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext stop for the day was the giant Super Autobacs store in Shinonome. notice the Toyota Chaser there in the corner?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0305.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8406\" title=\"aIMG_0305\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0305-e1338283361940.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis Super Autobacs was very similar to the one up in Gunma, except this one just had a bit more stuff. Especially Bubble Shifters! Sadly, they were alot stricter with taking pictures and I was forced to use my phone, which doesn't always focus properly. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0204.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8583\" title=\"DSC_0204\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_0204.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn our way out this Silvia was heard, and the guy was checking something with the engine since he kept revving it.

However, when we entered they made sure we knew that there was no english(which wasn't a problem) and that there's also a 5,000Yen($5 USD) seat fee. The place was pretty packed, and we figured we've seen enough maids, so we decided not to stick around. They didn't allow cameras in there obviously, so I wasn't able to take any pictures, but just from watching for a few minutes, its pretty cool and full of moe-overload. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8419\" title=\"aIMG_0321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/aIMG_0321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter scoping out Akihabara, we went back to my hotel to rest up for a bit before going to grab dinner.

THEY ALL COME WITH THAT. I don't quite get why since its not mentioned on the menu, but I guess its a mosburger special thing. Also, another thing I noticed is there's alot of places that have melon soda in japan, which tastes awesome.

One thing that I really liked about this unit, is the fact that it has the amp built into it, and also it features dual-sided 10\" subs.

Which was, my coilovers. Remember those torsen bearings I installed when I did the swift springs + corner balance? well...I sort of neglected them and the winter time turned them into rusy bearings that popped everytime I turned the wheel at slow speeds or a standstill.

One thing that sort of concerned me is how the pressure from one of the springs actually cut into the washer there on the right.

I ended up just putting the plastic washer back for now, as they don't make ugly popping noises, and work just fine for now. haha One thing I have to say, is I'm rather surprised with these Megan Racing coils. I've had them now since about 2009, and i've done track days as well as DD, and they've showed no signs of having any issues *knock on wood*. For 800 bucks, not a bad deal. Eventually I'd like to upgrade to some KW coils, but for now these will do just fine.^_^\r\n\r\nAnyway, moving on, I decided I had enough of my brakes rusting up. Same thing started happening as before, and my passenger front caliper started rusting up again. So, I then made up my mind to go full aluminum for brakes, and made that as being my next priority. I looked through my options, and almost settled on doing a full Z32 swap with aluminum stuff, but then my buddy ricky mentioned some nonsense about Cadillac CTS-V brakes for the fronts. well...turns out he was right! 0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8758\" title=\"yuki_ctsv_1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI picked up these set of 4-piston brembo's which are exactly the same caliper found on the EVO VIII for $150 bucks brand new from gmpartsdirect.com. Only downsite is it didn't come with the pins n stuff, so I had to order that from autozone for $20.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8750\" title=\"yuki_ctsv_2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nUsing these plus a bracket that Mazworx makes for $100 bucks, and some Evo VIII pads and rotors, you have a bolt up kit in the front for the S13! This is basically the same performance wise as doing the Evo VIII brake swap, but for a fraction of the price! Also, one thing I liked is these calipers were already silver, so I wont have to paint them :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/z32_knuckles.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8759\" title=\"z32_knuckles\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/z32_knuckles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs for the rear, I decided to stick with an aluminum Z32 setup but swapping out stock Steel knuckles for some Z32 Aluminum ones. I plan to swap out the old bushings for some SPL spherical ones to get smoother suspension movement, and prevent binding. This enables me to still keep things simple swap wise since its very popular, as well as reduce some unsprung weight! Also, with this total setup, I'm able to get some aggressive pads all around. That was one big thing I sort of didn't like about the Q45 setup, is not a very wide range of pads to choose from in the front.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/project_mu_hcplus.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8760\" title=\"project_mu_hcplus\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/project_mu_hcplus.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"891\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn that note, I plan to go with these Project Mu HC+ pads. I've ran Project Mu pads before in the past(B-Spec), and aside from the natural fade that occured while driving hard on stock s13 brakes, I felt like they dusted a bit too much. But, other than that I was very happy with them! Below you can see a nice chart showing their overall range of use, and these are the best pads in terms of temperature use! 0-800degree's is awesome! compared to the B-specs 0-500 temp.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8761\" title=\"pmu_brake_chart\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"278\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso, according to this chart, research i've done, and past experience with Project Mu pads, I'll get the best of both worlds in terms of having a good pad for both street and track use! ^_^\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8762\" title=\"dba-4000-5000series-580x561\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"561\" /></a>\r\nAs for rotors, I plan to go with these DBA 4000 series slotted rotors for now. I'd really love to rock 2-piece aluminum rotors as well, but they're a bit expensive and I would like to put that money into other things. haha\r\n\r\nGoing this route with the 4-piston CTS-V fronts and 2-piston Z32 rears actually helps out my overall brake bias. I was talking with Ken the other day about this, but realized some of my numbers were incorrect from memory and I had to re-calculate my numbers. For a reference, a stock s13 has a 70% brake bias towards the front. I have no chart for this anymore, and I'm too lazy to remake it. So, just trust me. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8763\" title=\"s13_q45f_z31bmc\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"543\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMy current setup with a 15/16\" BMC, and Q45 front calipers actually pushes me to 81% bias. This explains the big problem i've been having with the fronts locking up wayy too soon. I currently Have Federal 595's which are a pretty decent tire, so its not a matter of having some crappy all-season tire. lol I don't have ABS, so I do expect there to be some lockup if you just slam on the brakes obviously. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8764\" title=\"ctsv_z32_1516\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"533\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSwitching to this CTS-V front and Z32 rear setup, actually settles things back down to a solid 74%. I think this will feel better overall and help balance the car out alot more under hard braking.\r\n\r\nAlong with this, I plan to get a new sit of Dunlop Direzza Star Specs, which should also help provide a bit more grip as well under braking. Especially because for camber I'm running 3 degrees in the front and 2 in the rear. So, straight line braking isn't as great as it could be. I've also been tossing around the idea of trying a new set of wheels. Possibly some Enkei RPF-01's due to them being Forged, alot lighter than my current wheels, and balancing out a bit nicer. We'll see about those though a bit later on in the summer.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I've got the calipers already for the brake stuff, so now its just a matter of collecting all the remaining pieces, and bolting everything on! Getting this brake stuff finished up is my main goal for this summer. Once that's taken care of, I have some suspension bits, I'd like to replace before finally stashing away the rest of my money for importing an ae86, and my sr20vet motor swap in yuki! ^_^\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>Hey guys!</p>\n\n<p>So i've finally gotten some time to make a progress report on Yuki since coming back from Japan! ^_^ More pictures, and shtuff after the jump!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg\"><img title=\"yuki_ctsv_1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yuki_ctsv_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Anyways, first thing up was to get my sound system in order.

Below you can see a nice chart showing their overall range of use, and these are the best pads in terms of temperature use! 0-800degree's is awesome! compared to the B-specs 0-500 temp.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8761\" title=\"pmu_brake_chart\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/pmu_brake_chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"278\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also, according to this chart, research i've done, and past experience with Project Mu pads, I'll get the best of both worlds in terms of having a good pad for both street and track use! ^_^</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8762\" title=\"dba-4000-5000series-580x561\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dba-4000-5000series.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"561\" /></a> <br />\nAs for rotors, I plan to go with these DBA 4000 series slotted rotors for now. I'd really love to rock 2-piece aluminum rotors as well, but they're a bit expensive and I would like to put that money into other things. haha</p>\n\n<p>Going this route with the 4-piston CTS-V fronts and 2-piston Z32 rears actually helps out my overall brake bias. I was talking with Ken the other day about this, but realized some of my numbers were incorrect from memory and I had to re-calculate my numbers. For a reference, a stock s13 has a 70% brake bias towards the front. I have no chart for this anymore, and I'm too lazy to remake it. So, just trust me. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8763\" title=\"s13_q45f_z31bmc\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/s13_q45f_z31bmc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"543\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>My current setup with a 15/16\" BMC, and Q45 front calipers actually pushes me to 81% bias. This explains the big problem i've been having with the fronts locking up wayy too soon. I currently Have Federal 595's which are a pretty decent tire, so its not a matter of having some crappy all-season tire. lol I don't have ABS, so I do expect there to be some lockup if you just slam on the brakes obviously. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8764\" title=\"ctsv_z32_1516\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ctsv_z32_1516.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"533\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Switching to this CTS-V front and Z32 rear setup, actually settles things back down to a solid 74%. I think this will feel better overall and help balance the car out alot more under hard braking.</p>\n\n<p>Along with this, I plan to get a new sit of Dunlop Direzza Star Specs, which should also help provide a bit more grip as well under braking. Especially because for camber I'm running 3 degrees in the front and 2 in the rear. So, straight line braking isn't as great as it could be. I've also been tossing around the idea of trying a new set of wheels. Possibly some Enkei RPF-01's due to them being Forged, alot lighter than my current wheels, and balancing out a bit nicer. We'll see about those though a bit later on in the summer.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I've got the calipers already for the brake stuff, so now its just a matter of collecting all the remaining pieces, and bolting everything on! Getting this brake stuff finished up is my main goal for this summer. Once that's taken care of, I have some suspension bits, I'd like to replace before finally stashing away the rest of my money for importing an ae86, and my sr20vet motor swap in yuki! ^_^</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1343523829000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1406551377000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1343523829000,"published_by":1},{"id":1822,"uuid":"873b9eef-7872-44a1-8190-8f2a4165bf56","title":"Yuki:

Especially considering a set of front STI or EVO Brembo calipers will run you 300-400 bucks for a set of used ones. I could have cut costs even more by getting a set of used z32 calipers or some cheaper pads both front and rear. But, I felt it was important to get as much new parts as possible to start fresh.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_01781.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8892\" title=\"DSC_0178\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_01781.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick shot of the driver's side before the swap\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0179.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8890\" title=\"DSC_0179\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDriver's side rear before the swap\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0194.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8880\" title=\"DSC_0194\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0194.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI got started with taking everything apart, but forgot the one cardinal rule when it comes to taking LCA's off of the knuckle. When you pound on a ball joint or anything with threads for that matter....ALWAYS LEAVE THE NUT ON!!! I forgot this sadly, and by the time I realized what I had done...it was too late. bye-bye nismo LCA..:( I'll replace the balljoin eventually, but for now I needed a new one ASAP!\r\n\r\nI managed to get a replacement after searching around for a couple days from Greg over at <a href=\"http://www.feltonautoparts.com/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Felton's Auto Parts</a> here in Snohomish,WA. I managed to get a new LCA with the balljoint and bushing already pressed in for about $60! 0_o\r\n\r\nI forgot to take a picture of the new LCA, but its nothing special really. Once I got that, I was able to keep chugging away at the swap.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8881\" title=\"DSC_0192\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI was a little bit confused with how the bracket went on at first. I had thought it went behind the knuckle initially, so I got out my dremel to start gruming away the extra chunk of metal, then realized it didn't need to be done. Mazworx didn't send any instructions for how the bracket goes, and which bolt goes where, but after a little bit of playing with it, I was able to figure it out. This is how the bracket should fit on the passenger side.\r\n\r\n<strong>Upper knuckle hole(non threaded hole on bracket) = longest bolt</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Lower knuckle hole = smallest bolt</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Bottom hole on bracket = medium size bolt</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8885\" title=\"DSC_0185\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe only real unexpected hiccup I ran into with this swap was having to grind down these ribs on the caliper in order for the bracket to fit.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8882\" title=\"DSC_0191\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn this caliper, I just used a small electric dremel, but it took a little while. So, I ran next door and borrowed my neighbors 6\" bench grinder for the next one, which made quick work of the soft aluinum!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8883\" title=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe bracket should sit flush like so\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8884\" title=\"DSC_0188\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nanother angle of how the bracket should sit for the passenger side caliper.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8886\" title=\"DSC_0184\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nold and busted. Note the rust on this caliper even though its probably only 6 months old...just another great reason to switch to aluminum.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0197.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8878\" title=\"DSC_0197\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0197.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nnew hotness!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8879\" title=\"DSC_0196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0196.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI did run into one issue with the Z32 conversion lines in the front, and the angle they have to take coming out of the caliper.

Time to go bed in the pads, and test everything\r\n<h4>Impressions</h4>\r\nFirst off, I'll explain that these brakes barely even stopped when I first pulled out of the driveway. I just did a few test stops from 10mph, and naturally there wasn't much bite there. I proceeded to drive around my neighborhood, and did about 10-15 stops with medium braking from 30mph and about 20-30 seconds between each stop. After that, I left the brakes cool down for about 5 minutes. then went out and did about 5-10 stops from 45-50mph with another 30 seconds between each one. I'd say just before I switched to the 50mph stops is when I felt the brakes really start biting, and working properly.\r\n\r\nOverall, these stopping power this swap provides is AMAZING! the brake balance for this swap when combines with my 15/16\" Brake Master Cylinder feels perfect! when I really lay into the brakes, I'm able to modulate the pressure pretty well compared to just instantly locking like i've heard with some full Z32 swaps. One thing to take note of, is these pads because they're meant to be used in both track and street applications, they have a slight squeel to them when coming to a stop. But, anybody that's owned high performance pads similar to Hawk HP+ or something similar will understand what i'm talking about. I also noticed that the the steering seems to be a tad bit heavier in the front. I think if I had gone with some 2pc rotors, that would have kept the feeling about the same. So, possibly switching to that, as well as some lighter forged wheels in the future will help with eliminating some of that.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint, is compared to my Q45 brakes, there's a bit less pedal pressure. But, I think it'll just take some getting used to. There's still pretty good pressure, just not what i'm used to from before. I'm going to run everything for this week, then sometime next weekend, I'll do a final flush of everything using my Motul fluid. I found out, I had some extra fluid laying around. so, instead of using my Motul, I used that stuff for now.","html":"<p>After spending many hours in frustration over the weekend and the past couple days, I've finally completed my CTS-V/Z32 brake swap! write-up and more pics after the jump! <br />\nいまはちょっといそがしいから。あとで、にほんごかきますよ！;)</p>\n\n<p>Note: If you haven't checked out my progress posts regarding the brake swap, its worth doing so! there's some good information regarding z32 anchor bolts, brake bias, and other stuff!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/2012/07/yuki-upgrades-summer-2012/\">http://domofactor.com/2012/07/yuki-upgrades-summer-2012/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/2012/10/yuki-cts-vz32-brake-swap-progress/\">http://domofactor.com/2012/10/yuki-cts-vz32-brake-swap-progress/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0198.jpg\"><img title=\"DSC_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0198.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>First off, I laid everything that the swap requires.

Especially considering a set of front STI or EVO Brembo calipers will run you 300-400 bucks for a set of used ones. I could have cut costs even more by getting a set of used z32 calipers or some cheaper pads both front and rear. But, I felt it was important to get as much new parts as possible to start fresh.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_01781.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8892\" title=\"DSC_0178\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_01781.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick shot of the driver's side before the swap</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0179.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8890\" title=\"DSC_0179\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0179.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Driver's side rear before the swap</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0194.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8880\" title=\"DSC_0194\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0194.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I got started with taking everything apart, but forgot the one cardinal rule when it comes to taking LCA's off of the knuckle. When you pound on a ball joint or anything with threads for that matter....ALWAYS LEAVE THE NUT ON!!! I forgot this sadly, and by the time I realized what I had done...it was too late. bye-bye nismo LCA..:( I'll replace the balljoin eventually, but for now I needed a new one ASAP!</p>\n\n<p>I managed to get a replacement after searching around for a couple days from Greg over at <a href=\"http://www.feltonautoparts.com/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Felton's Auto Parts</a> here in Snohomish,WA. I managed to get a new LCA with the balljoint and bushing already pressed in for about $60! 0_o</p>\n\n<p>I forgot to take a picture of the new LCA, but its nothing special really. Once I got that, I was able to keep chugging away at the swap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8881\" title=\"DSC_0192\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0192.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I was a little bit confused with how the bracket went on at first. I had thought it went behind the knuckle initially, so I got out my dremel to start gruming away the extra chunk of metal, then realized it didn't need to be done. Mazworx didn't send any instructions for how the bracket goes, and which bolt goes where, but after a little bit of playing with it, I was able to figure it out. This is how the bracket should fit on the passenger side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upper knuckle hole(non threaded hole on bracket) = longest bolt</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lower knuckle hole = smallest bolt</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom hole on bracket = medium size bolt</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8885\" title=\"DSC_0185\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0185.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The only real unexpected hiccup I ran into with this swap was having to grind down these ribs on the caliper in order for the bracket to fit.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8882\" title=\"DSC_0191\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0191.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On this caliper, I just used a small electric dremel, but it took a little while. So, I ran next door and borrowed my neighbors 6\" bench grinder for the next one, which made quick work of the soft aluinum!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8883\" title=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The bracket should sit flush like so</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8884\" title=\"DSC_0188\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0188.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>another angle of how the bracket should sit for the passenger side caliper.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8886\" title=\"DSC_0184\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0184.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>old and busted.

The night before the drift even, my motor completely died on the way home from work, and I ended up having to wait for the tow-truck for 3 hours! &gt;&lt; Luckily, I had enough ride height, to get on/off without the need for ramps. :p Later that night, my friends and I found the problem to be the brand new rotor I bought for my distributor just stopped working. After putting my old broken one on, the car fired right up! So, on the way to the track in the morning I bought a another new one just incase. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9104\" alt=\"382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt Last!

I decided to upgrade to Deatschwerks' new turbin style 255lph fuel pump, and OEM Z32 fuel filter.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dizzy-rotor-broken.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9106\" alt=\"dizzy-rotor-broken\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dizzy-rotor-broken.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I also happened to check my distributor cap &amp; rotor only to find, that my rotor was...well..broken. lol I'm still kind of amazed the thing even ran!

The night before the drift even, my motor completely died on the way home from work, and I ended up having to wait for the tow-truck for 3 hours! &gt;&lt; Luckily, I had enough ride height, to get on/off without the need for ramps. :p Later that night, my friends and I found the problem to be the brand new rotor I bought for my distributor just stopped working. After putting my old broken one on, the car fired right up! So, on the way to the track in the morning I bought a another new one just incase. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9104\" alt=\"382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382183_10200250813780478_668677516_n.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At Last!

But, to be perfectly honest….. I don’t actually remember what sparked my interest. All I know is one moment, I had thought it was interesting, and then the next I really REALLY wanted a car of my own, and to learn more about cars and motorsports. I do remember though, the first time I saw drifting online I had thought the car was gonna go flying off the corner, and then the unthinkable happened.

It was totally by random, because I was looking into getting a 5 speed swap done on my car, and then I randomly found his shop <a href=\"http://divinedrift.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kami Dori</a> on myspace. After initially getting the 5speed swap done, I went back time and time again, and we’ve been friend’s ever since. It’s kind of funny how much stuff people have in common when they randomly meet each other. But, much props goes to him as he’s taught me LOADS about car and motorsports stuff in general. I honestly think that I wouldn’t know anywhere near as much as I do today without his help. </p>  <p>Since this was my daily driver for school, and work I didn’t do much to it. I managed to get my 5-speed swap from ricky, Injen cold air intake, Megan Racing 2.5” exhaust, some Megan coilovers, XXR 002 wheels, nissan sentra/pathfinder fog lights, 97’ Infiniti Q45 brakes and of course my domo drift charm.lol </p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"337\" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s a pic from when I was at an auto-x event earlier last year.</p>  <p><strong><u><font size=\"3\"></font></u></strong></p>  <p><strong><u><font size=\"3\">Clash!</font></u></strong></p>  <p>It was probably 6 months after this picture was taken that the worst possible thing happened. After just recently installing a new sparco bucket seat, I wanted to test it out on the way home to see how the seat felt. sadly, I forgot that my rear tires were pretty worn, and that there was an elevation change in the corner I was driving on. this put me into a battle head on with a Chevy Silverado..and..we both ended up knocking each other out so to speak. I ended up knocking his tranny loose, blowing out his rear leaf spring, and axel, and shifted the frame a good six inches. as for my car? well…..something like this…</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>also my poor hello kitty license place frame!!! no0o0o0o<img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png\" /></p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>the hit managed to snap my coilover clean in half…</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>all hope isn’t lost though! my motor was still good to go!</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>the shockwave was actually so bad it went all the way through to my roof<img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png\" /> luckily, I walked away without a scratch.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Well, That’s about it for the first part.

But, to be perfectly honest….. I don’t actually remember what sparked my interest. All I know is one moment, I had thought it was interesting, and then the next I really REALLY wanted a car of my own, and to learn more about cars and motorsports. I do remember though, the first time I saw drifting online I had thought the car was gonna go flying off the corner, and then the unthinkable happened. While I thought drifting was amazing, I didn’t go crazy about it at first like some people now days. Initially I was interested in grip racing and circuit stuff.</font></p>  <p>I think initially, the interest sparked when I used to live in Hawai’i.(side note, my dad’s retired Navy, so I lived in a lot of different places). to prevent confusion, here’s a list of place’s that I’ve lived in order up until now.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&#160; 1.

It was totally by random, because I was looking into getting a 5 speed swap done on my car, and then I randomly found his shop <a href=\"http://divinedrift.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kami Dori</a> on myspace. After initially getting the 5speed swap done, I went back time and time again, and we’ve been friend’s ever since. It’s kind of funny how much stuff people have in common when they randomly meet each other. But, much props goes to him as he’s taught me LOADS about car and motorsports stuff in general. I honestly think that I wouldn’t know anywhere near as much as I do today without his help. </p>  <p>Since this was my daily driver for school, and work I didn’t do much to it. I managed to get my 5-speed swap from ricky, Injen cold air intake, Megan Racing 2.5” exhaust, some Megan coilovers, XXR 002 wheels, nissan sentra/pathfinder fog lights, 97’ Infiniti Q45 brakes and of course my domo drift charm.lol </p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_98fcfe3d667240059807bb19546312f3.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"337\" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s a pic from when I was at an auto-x event earlier last year.</p>  <p><strong><u><font size=\"3\"></font></u></strong></p>  <p><strong><u><font size=\"3\">Clash!</font></u></strong></p>  <p>It was probably 6 months after this picture was taken that the worst possible thing happened. After just recently installing a new sparco bucket seat, I wanted to test it out on the way home to see how the seat felt. sadly, I forgot that my rear tires were pretty worn, and that there was an elevation change in the corner I was driving on. this put me into a battle head on with a Chevy Silverado..and..we both ended up knocking each other out so to speak. I ended up knocking his tranny loose, blowing out his rear leaf spring, and axel, and shifted the frame a good six inches. as for my car? well…..something like this…</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_2daa6de5e4fb449d9dc1cc53e532b50c.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>also my poor hello kitty license place frame!!! no0o0o0o<img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png\" /></p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_beadd1b0001f49089c930c95b15a0706.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>the hit managed to snap my coilover clean in half…</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_6238df83230c4c21990bdd2cab2d8fd1.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>all hope isn’t lost though! my motor was still good to go!</p>  <p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 8px 0px 4px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419\" border=\"0\" alt=\"l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/l_a75562079d72461baaf3982e0b136419.jpg\" width=\"504\" height=\"404\" /></a></p>  <p>the shockwave was actually so bad it went all the way through to my roof<img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile\" alt=\"Sad smile\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png\" /> luckily, I walked away without a scratch.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Well, That’s about it for the first part.

I've got a bit of catchup to do since its Day 2 as I'm typing this, but hopefully I can continue to stay ontop of these. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9357\" alt=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nSo, to start off from the very beginning, my day didn't start very well leaving seattle. I ended up running a bit late to the airport, and just barely missed the check-in time. My flight was originally at 12:30, then a 3 hour layover in LA before heading to Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Luckily, there was anoher fight to LA around 2pm I could take, and managed to get switched over to that one, and have my $25 fee waived. So, props to the awesome Alaska Airlines staff for getting me sorted out!\r\n\r\nAfter arriving into Tokyo around 11, it took me roughly an hour to go through customs, immigration, get my bags, and sort through the money exchange. By the time that all was finished and I went to catch the train, I literally missed the last one out of haneda by about 1 minute due to the trains stopping around midnight here.(yeah, its really stupid I know...) This meant that I had two options.\r\n\r\nA) Take the Monorail to hamamatsucho and get stuck there\r\n\r\nB) Take a Taxi to my friend's place directly.\r\n\r\nI opted for B, but man was it expensive as hell...&gt;&lt; Luckily I finally got to ride on he Legendary C1 route through tokyo, and saw a few cool cars like the new 86 in the blurry picture below! The taxi ride from Haneda to Musashinoshi costed me around $150..\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9380\" alt=\"IMG_1161\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1161-e1369031274766.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI was pretty wiped from the plane, so I I wanted to just unpack my bags, then crash. But, nooooo, we were having none of that due to this little surprise I found in my bag. Apparently, the airport people love tossing bags around, and stupid me forgot to make sure the jar of cheese dip was properly coushined. The tip popped off, and the whole thing exploded everyhere. Luckily, all of the food I had could just be cleaned off, and it was still fine. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9381\" alt=\"IMG_1164\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164-e1369031289959.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nHere's just a quick shot of the room I'm staying in. The room itself it pretty cool since it has the traditional Tatami mats and futon which are both pretty soft and comfortable.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0009\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe next morning my buddy Ken and his wife Tomi decided to take me out to Sizzler. Which was a bit funny considering i've never even been to any of the ones in the US. lol I failed and forgot to get pictures of the food, but they basically had regular breakfast stuff, along with curry,miso soup, and other more japanese style breakfast foods. all of it was pretty good and was buffet style for about $10 I think.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9247\" alt=\"DSC_0008\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI remember talking to my friend Hideki about a Gymkhana event going on up at Tsukuba that same day, but I didn't know any of the details. I decided to give him a call to see what was going on, and see if it was even worth making the 3 hour trip over to Tsukuba Circuit knowing it was around 11 am at the time.\r\n\r\nLuckily he said they were going to be running until 4-5pm, and if I bring my helmet I can do some driving. I instantly grabbed me stuff and hopped on the train with Ken and Tomi who decided to tag along. On the way to the station, I noticed there was a driving school nearby. I like how they actually setup courses to let people practice first, instead of just throwing them into live traffic like they do in the US.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9250\" alt=\"DSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI notifced this seemingly abondoned/run down house as well along the way. I didn't notice it at the time, but now that i've looked at the picture its pretty funny since the katakana there reads \"kuriinhaitsu\" or \"Clean Heights\". Which...from the looks of it...its definitely not. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9253\" alt=\"DSC_0018\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\nWhen we got on the train there was a film crew taking video of some group of comedians doing some talk show/vlog thing...it was pretty funny since they kept following us during all of our train transfers. Luckily, I tried to do my best obama impression just incase it gets caught on video! :p\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9255\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I do really like is how they have vending machines for drinks EVERYWHERE. if there's a zombie apocalypse, you're definitely not going to die from lack of fluids. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9260\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWERE COMING FOR YOU TSUKUBA!!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9262\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGetting on our last transfer on the way to the circuit....but....where's the rest of the train....0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9261\" alt=\"DSC_0034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at Tsukuba!!! It was pretty surreal to actually be here. One thing I noticed right away, is this tunnel that goes underneath Corner #2 to the pits, used to also have a sign that said \"Get to the Win!\" in engrish. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9385\" alt=\"IMG_1168\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168-e1369033711662.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI didn't enter the main section of the circut since I was on a time crunch and needed to meet Hideki over on the gymkhana course. Right away, I noticed some lone Porsche sitting off in the distance and went to take a quick look.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9267\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nLooks like my insincts were correct, and I managed to see my first RWB(Rauh-Welt Begriff) Porsche in person. I have to say it was pretty amazing, and its no wonder Sakai-san has the following that he does nor only in Japan, but recently worldwide!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9268\" alt=\"DSC_0046\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI managed to snap a few pictures from the main grandstands area while running around.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9279\" alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOne interesting car I ran into straight away was this Formula Kei car. It's basically similar to a formula 3 car, but just a bit smaller with less power. It looked pretty impressive out there compared to all the other cars.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9289\" alt=\"DSC_0098\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nShortly after wandering through the pits I ran into Hideki and his friend Wataru who was currently taking a few runs in the AE86 shop car from <a href=\"http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">4-Foot Garage Miura</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9293\" alt=\"DSC_0102\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI soon found out that Wataru also does drifting and owns a S13 Silvia. A little while later we hit it off once I told him about my s13 and started showing him my build pics. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9302\" alt=\"DSC_0134\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Silvia's I also met his wife Azusa who was driving a Midnight Purple S14 with an N/A SR. She also has a 180 that is used for drifting that is also Midnight Purple. When I told her we didn't have that color on Silvia's/180's in the US the look on her face was priceless. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9343\" alt=\"DSC_0204\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nHideki also introduced me to his girlfriend Natsuko who drove this black FD3S. I managed to grab some video footage of one of her runs down towards the bottom of this post!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9359\" alt=\"DSC_0230\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9308\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter watching people drive to get a feel for the course, I ran around trying to source some long sleeves and pants to I could do a few runs in the AE86. I found some....but...they didn't quite fit the best. :p and yes, that is a man wearing pink bunny ears, they probably give him +5hp or something. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9347\" alt=\"DSC_0208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext up, it was my turn to give it a go. Even just sitting in the car, everything felt super wierd and shifted to the right. I've driven a couple RHD cars already from last year when I came to japan. But, it was only for a couple days, so it still takes some getting used to.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9312\" alt=\"DSC_0151\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI didn't realize it at the time, but I only had 2 runs, and not 3. I took it pretty easy on the first one just to get the course memorized. Then was going to go all out on my second one.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9324\" alt=\"DSC_0174\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI pulled in after the first run to go over some different lines and how to best attack the course. Now, I kind of get how F1 driver's feel during Hotlaps for qualifying. Granted, they've already had some practice sessions to hash out how the cars feels and whatnot. but, it was still pretty intersting just showing up, and being given 2 runs and adapting to a new car along with RHD to top it off.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9329\" alt=\"DSC_0183\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nWaiting in the grid for go-time!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9292\" alt=\"DSC_0101\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGreen flag lifts, and i'm off. Its always awesome how when you're waiting for the signal, you're mind blanks, and all you can hear is the sound of your heart pounding away from the adrenaline.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9337\" alt=\"DSC_0196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSadly, I didn't manage to put in a very clean run. Having to look down when finding the shifter, along with not being used to shift with my left hand really threw off my mechanics. lol Hopefully, I'll be able to practice at it a bit more in the future! I was surprised with how responsive this 86 was, the engine sounded great, and there was a bit of bog in the carbs at some of the lower rpm's. but, having a stock KA back at home, I'm not used to rapping the crap out of a car, especially one that's not mine. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9338\" alt=\"DSC_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfterwards I went to talk with Azusa and Wataru about various s13/nissan stuff. It's always cool when you can go half-way across the world and find people who are interested in the same things as you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9350\" alt=\"DSC_0212\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nAzusa and Natsuko ended up getting 2nd and 3rd in the woman's class!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9362\" alt=\"DSC_0234\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nHideki also places 7th in his class, but since he was busy packing up his things during the ending ceremonies, Wataru proudly stood-in for him. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9371\" alt=\"DSC_0254\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs usual, there's a few people that really like to enjoy themselves, and make other people have a few laughs. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9373\" alt=\"DSC_0261\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSomehow the mask also made its way into the Formula Kei car as well. I think the need to mound that there permanently to strike fear into whichever car is ahead of it. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9366\" alt=\"DSC_0242\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI had a great time, and snapped a few photoshoot worthy pics of Hideki and Natsuko. They then surprised me and said we'd get to do some pace laps around the main course. to which, I nearly ran and jumped around like a schoolgirl when I found this out. Video of the pace laps is down below!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9390\" alt=\"IMG_1173\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173-e1369037264144.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI had a great time with everyone and can't wait to see them all again at the Idler's event on 6/2!! It was great meeting everyone, and also thanks to Masaya(guy in orange) for an awesome event!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1175\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty long day, and I was started to feel the jetlag kick in. One thing that's interesting to note, is just how far out into the countryside some of these circuits are. This is the little train station called Sodo that we got off/on at, and from here you need to take a taxi to the circuit for about 10minutes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9377\" alt=\"DSC_0269\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDinner before going to bed was some Katsu Curry and rice! Overall this trip it starting off great, and it will be hard to top this level of awesome-ness for day #2. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9393\" alt=\"IMG_1176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176-e1369037482639.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Here's some video from the day:</strong>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/635BFJRgHpQ\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xzOU4F7Eyv8\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ySGgGwC82Qw\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nXsLHpy9ZgI\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/635BFJRgHpQ\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176.jpg\">[gallery ids=\"9394,9393,9392,9391,9390,9389,9377,9376,9375,9374,9373,9372,9371,9370,9369,9368,9367,9366,9365,9364,9363,9362,9361,9360,9359,9358,9357,9356,9355,9351,9350,9349,9348,9347,9346,9345,9344,9343,9342,9341,9340,9339,9338,9337,9336,9335,9334,9333,9332,9331,9330,9329,9328,9327,9326,9325,9324,9323,9322,9321,9320,9319,9318,9317,9316,9315,9314,9313,9312,9311,9310,9309,9388,9308,9307,9306,9305,9304,9303,9302,9301,9300,9299,9298,9297,9296,9295,9294,9293,9292,9291,9290,9289,9288,9287,9286,9285,9284,9283,9282,9281,9280,9279,9278,9277,9276,9275,9274,9273,9272,9271,9270,9269,9268,9267,9266,9385,9265,9264,9263,9262,9261,9382,9260,9259,9258,9257,9256,9255,9384,9254,9383,9253,9252,9251,9250,9249,9248,9247,9246,9245,9381,9380\"]\r\n\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n\n<p>So, I recently decided to take another trip to Japan for around 2 weeks! I've got a bit of catchup to do since its Day 2 as I'm typing this, but hopefully I can continue to stay ontop of these. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9357\" alt=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0226.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>So, to start off from the very beginning, my day didn't start very well leaving seattle. I ended up running a bit late to the airport, and just barely missed the check-in time. My flight was originally at 12:30, then a 3 hour layover in LA before heading to Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Luckily, there was anoher fight to LA around 2pm I could take, and managed to get switched over to that one, and have my $25 fee waived. So, props to the awesome Alaska Airlines staff for getting me sorted out!</p>\n\n<p>After arriving into Tokyo around 11, it took me roughly an hour to go through customs, immigration, get my bags, and sort through the money exchange. By the time that all was finished and I went to catch the train, I literally missed the last one out of haneda by about 1 minute due to the trains stopping around midnight here.(yeah, its really stupid I know...) This meant that I had two options.</p>\n\n<p>A) Take the Monorail to hamamatsucho and get stuck there</p>\n\n<p>B) Take a Taxi to my friend's place directly.</p>\n\n<p>I opted for B, but man was it expensive as hell...&gt;&lt; Luckily I finally got to ride on he Legendary C1 route through tokyo, and saw a few cool cars like the new 86 in the blurry picture below! The taxi ride from Haneda to Musashinoshi costed me around $150..</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9380\" alt=\"IMG_1161\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1161-e1369031274766.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I was pretty wiped from the plane, so I I wanted to just unpack my bags, then crash. But, nooooo, we were having none of that due to this little surprise I found in my bag. Apparently, the airport people love tossing bags around, and stupid me forgot to make sure the jar of cheese dip was properly coushined. The tip popped off, and the whole thing exploded everyhere. Luckily, all of the food I had could just be cleaned off, and it was still fine. :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9381\" alt=\"IMG_1164\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1164-e1369031289959.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Here's just a quick shot of the room I'm staying in. The room itself it pretty cool since it has the traditional Tatami mats and futon which are both pretty soft and comfortable.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0009\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0009.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The next morning my buddy Ken and his wife Tomi decided to take me out to Sizzler. Which was a bit funny considering i've never even been to any of the ones in the US. lol I failed and forgot to get pictures of the food, but they basically had regular breakfast stuff, along with curry,miso soup, and other more japanese style breakfast foods. all of it was pretty good and was buffet style for about $10 I think. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9247\" alt=\"DSC_0008\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0008.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I remember talking to my friend Hideki about a Gymkhana event going on up at Tsukuba that same day, but I didn't know any of the details. I decided to give him a call to see what was going on, and see if it was even worth making the 3 hour trip over to Tsukuba Circuit knowing it was around 11 am at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily he said they were going to be running until 4-5pm, and if I bring my helmet I can do some driving. I instantly grabbed me stuff and hopped on the train with Ken and Tomi who decided to tag along. On the way to the station, I noticed there was a driving school nearby. I like how they actually setup courses to let people practice first, instead of just throwing them into live traffic like they do in the US.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9250\" alt=\"DSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0014.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I notifced this seemingly abondoned/run down house as well along the way. I didn't notice it at the time, but now that i've looked at the picture its pretty funny since the katakana there reads \"kuriinhaitsu\" or \"Clean Heights\". Which...from the looks of it...its definitely not. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9253\" alt=\"DSC_0018\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0018.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a> <br />\nWhen we got on the train there was a film crew taking video of some group of comedians doing some talk show/vlog thing...it was pretty funny since they kept following us during all of our train transfers. Luckily, I tried to do my best obama impression just incase it gets caught on video! :p <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9255\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0022.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I do really like is how they have vending machines for drinks EVERYWHERE. if there's a zombie apocalypse, you're definitely not going to die from lack of fluids. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9260\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0029.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>WERE COMING FOR YOU TSUKUBA!!!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9262\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0035.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Getting on our last transfer on the way to the circuit....but....where's the rest of the train....0_o</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9261\" alt=\"DSC_0034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0034.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we arrive at Tsukuba!!! It was pretty surreal to actually be here. One thing I noticed right away, is this tunnel that goes underneath Corner #2 to the pits, used to also have a sign that said \"Get to the Win!\" in engrish. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9385\" alt=\"IMG_1168\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1168-e1369033711662.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I didn't enter the main section of the circut since I was on a time crunch and needed to meet Hideki over on the gymkhana course. Right away, I noticed some lone Porsche sitting off in the distance and went to take a quick look.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9267\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0045.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Looks like my insincts were correct, and I managed to see my first RWB(Rauh-Welt Begriff) Porsche in person. I have to say it was pretty amazing, and its no wonder Sakai-san has the following that he does nor only in Japan, but recently worldwide!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9268\" alt=\"DSC_0046\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0046.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I managed to snap a few pictures from the main grandstands area while running around.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9279\" alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>One interesting car I ran into straight away was this Formula Kei car. It's basically similar to a formula 3 car, but just a bit smaller with less power. It looked pretty impressive out there compared to all the other cars.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9289\" alt=\"DSC_0098\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0098.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Shortly after wandering through the pits I ran into Hideki and his friend Wataru who was currently taking a few runs in the AE86 shop car from <a href=\"http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">4-Foot Garage Miura</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9293\" alt=\"DSC_0102\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0102.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I soon found out that Wataru also does drifting and owns a S13 Silvia. A little while later we hit it off once I told him about my s13 and started showing him my build pics. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9302\" alt=\"DSC_0134\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0134.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Silvia's I also met his wife Azusa who was driving a Midnight Purple S14 with an N/A SR. She also has a 180 that is used for drifting that is also Midnight Purple. When I told her we didn't have that color on Silvia's/180's in the US the look on her face was priceless. :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9343\" alt=\"DSC_0204\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0204.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Hideki also introduced me to his girlfriend Natsuko who drove this black FD3S. I managed to grab some video footage of one of her runs down towards the bottom of this post!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9359\" alt=\"DSC_0230\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0230.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9308\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0143.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After watching people drive to get a feel for the course, I ran around trying to source some long sleeves and pants to I could do a few runs in the AE86. I found some....but...they didn't quite fit the best. :p and yes, that is a man wearing pink bunny ears, they probably give him +5hp or something. haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9347\" alt=\"DSC_0208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0208.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Next up, it was my turn to give it a go. Even just sitting in the car, everything felt super wierd and shifted to the right. I've driven a couple RHD cars already from last year when I came to japan. But, it was only for a couple days, so it still takes some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9312\" alt=\"DSC_0151\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0151.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I didn't realize it at the time, but I only had 2 runs, and not 3. I took it pretty easy on the first one just to get the course memorized. Then was going to go all out on my second one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9324\" alt=\"DSC_0174\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0174.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I pulled in after the first run to go over some different lines and how to best attack the course. Now, I kind of get how F1 driver's feel during Hotlaps for qualifying. Granted, they've already had some practice sessions to hash out how the cars feels and whatnot. but, it was still pretty intersting just showing up, and being given 2 runs and adapting to a new car along with RHD to top it off.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9329\" alt=\"DSC_0183\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0183.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Waiting in the grid for go-time!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9292\" alt=\"DSC_0101\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0101.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Green flag lifts, and i'm off. Its always awesome how when you're waiting for the signal, you're mind blanks, and all you can hear is the sound of your heart pounding away from the adrenaline.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9337\" alt=\"DSC_0196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0196.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Sadly, I didn't manage to put in a very clean run. Having to look down when finding the shifter, along with not being used to shift with my left hand really threw off my mechanics. lol Hopefully, I'll be able to practice at it a bit more in the future! I was surprised with how responsive this 86 was, the engine sounded great, and there was a bit of bog in the carbs at some of the lower rpm's. but, having a stock KA back at home, I'm not used to rapping the crap out of a car, especially one that's not mine. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9338\" alt=\"DSC_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0198.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Afterwards I went to talk with Azusa and Wataru about various s13/nissan stuff. It's always cool when you can go half-way across the world and find people who are interested in the same things as you.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9350\" alt=\"DSC_0212\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0212.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Azusa and Natsuko ended up getting 2nd and 3rd in the woman's class!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9362\" alt=\"DSC_0234\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0234.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Hideki also places 7th in his class, but since he was busy packing up his things during the ending ceremonies, Wataru proudly stood-in for him. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9371\" alt=\"DSC_0254\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0254.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As usual, there's a few people that really like to enjoy themselves, and make other people have a few laughs. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9373\" alt=\"DSC_0261\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Somehow the mask also made its way into the Formula Kei car as well. I think the need to mound that there permanently to strike fear into whichever car is ahead of it. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9366\" alt=\"DSC_0242\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0242.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I had a great time, and snapped a few photoshoot worthy pics of Hideki and Natsuko. They then surprised me and said we'd get to do some pace laps around the main course. to which, I nearly ran and jumped around like a schoolgirl when I found this out. Video of the pace laps is down below!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9390\" alt=\"IMG_1173\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1173-e1369037264144.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I had a great time with everyone and can't wait to see them all again at the Idler's event on 6/2!! It was great meeting everyone, and also thanks to Masaya(guy in orange) for an awesome event!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1175\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1175.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It was a pretty long day, and I was started to feel the jetlag kick in. One thing that's interesting to note, is just how far out into the countryside some of these circuits are. This is the little train station called Sodo that we got off/on at, and from here you need to take a taxi to the circuit for about 10minutes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9377\" alt=\"DSC_0269\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0269.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Dinner before going to bed was some Katsu Curry and rice! Overall this trip it starting off great, and it will be hard to top this level of awesome-ness for day #2. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9393\" alt=\"IMG_1176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176-e1369037482639.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's some video from the day:</strong>  </p>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/635BFJRgHpQ\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xzOU4F7Eyv8\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ySGgGwC82Qw\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nXsLHpy9ZgI\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/635BFJRgHpQ\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1176.jpg\">[gallery ids=\"9394,9393,9392,9391,9390,9389,9377,9376,9375,9374,9373,9372,9371,9370,9369,9368,9367,9366,9365,9364,9363,9362,9361,9360,9359,9358,9357,9356,9355,9351,9350,9349,9348,9347,9346,9345,9344,9343,9342,9341,9340,9339,9338,9337,9336,9335,9334,9333,9332,9331,9330,9329,9328,9327,9326,9325,9324,9323,9322,9321,9320,9319,9318,9317,9316,9315,9314,9313,9312,9311,9310,9309,9388,9308,9307,9306,9305,9304,9303,9302,9301,9300,9299,9298,9297,9296,9295,9294,9293,9292,9291,9290,9289,9288,9287,9286,9285,9284,9283,9282,9281,9280,9279,9278,9277,9276,9275,9274,9273,9272,9271,9270,9269,9268,9267,9266,9385,9265,9264,9263,9262,9261,9382,9260,9259,9258,9257,9256,9255,9384,9254,9383,9253,9252,9251,9250,9249,9248,9247,9246,9245,9381,9380\"]</p>\n\n<p></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1369021512000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719442000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1369021512000,"published_by":1},{"id":1832,"uuid":"93971c3c-aa38-491f-92c2-7859e93cedcd","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 2 (Musashino Exploring)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-2-musashino-exploring","markdown":"Hello again! A bit late on getting these up since I've been pretty busy as its day #5 right now as I write this. haha Anywho, on Day 2 I was pretty tired from the trip up to tsukuba, and the jetlag so I just decided to stick close to my friend's house and do some exploring.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CSC_0013.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9416\" alt=\"CSC_0013\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CSC_0013.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI started off tinkering with some of the filters on my camera, since I had never really used them. haha I really liked this sepia toned one since it fits with the rust shack and old school style gas pump. :p\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9417\" alt=\"CSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CSC_0014.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI noticed they had this cool hill for practicing skii-ing and snowboarding on. It kind of reminded me of that korean movie Take Off.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00121.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9426\" alt=\"DSC_0012\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00121.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why, but I found this tree thingy interesting....so I took a picture. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00111.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9425\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00111.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the main pathways when you first enter the park. I was surprised at how huge this place was. I only made it about halfway through before it started to rain pretty hard.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9421\" alt=\"DSC_0005\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00051.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting out of the park, I stumped across these cool looking shrine\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0020.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9431\" alt=\"DSC_0020\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0020.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that kind of throws me off, is where the sidewalk will randomly end, and you need to change sides of the road. Luckily, it didn't end, but instead turned into this long corridor of greens, and puddles. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00231.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9432\" alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSince it was raining pretty hard, and I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I decided to finally try some ramen here in japan. Amazingly enough, it was my first time having regular type ramen.(last time I had tsukemen)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00192.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9430\" alt=\"DSC_0019\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00192.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI walked in and was greeted by these 2 old ladies, who were pretty surprised to be seeing a foreigner just randomly pop up at their little hole-in-the-wall ramen shop. Luckily they seemed a bit more reassured once they realized I could speak japanese. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00172.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0017\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00172.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI ended up ordering some Miso Chashu, which was really good. The only different I noticed compared to the ones I've had in Seattle is this one was a bit more saltier than I was used to. Overall it was great, and was a decent price at $7.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00152.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00152.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting lunch, I ran into these pair of awesome mini-looking advans! haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1178.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9434\" alt=\"IMG_1178\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1178-e1369284187176.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTurns out they were from this VIP shop called Supirior\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1179.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9435\" alt=\"IMG_1179\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1179-e1369284234198.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso spotted this not-so-good looking Honda accord.

I noticed they had this movie which Derrick has been searching for recently.

The fatter one on the right there is only found on the 1990 N/A 300ZX.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this, is that the Z32 hub actually has slightly different spacing in 1990 or lackthereof really, than all the other versions. The Z32 hub has a plate that the anchor bolt goes onto. This rises the anchor bolt about 6mm which accounts for the difference in space over the thicker one. It's a common mistake people have been making when doing 5lug/z32 swaps into their S13's from what i've seen.\r\n\r\nlet's put all the fact's i've researched into one place. The following is what's needed depending on the hub you're using.\r\n\r\n<strong>S13 4lug, Ichiba 5lug conversion, R32 GTS-T, Z32 1990 hubs = Thicker anchor bolt</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Z32 91+, S14, R32 GTR hubs = Thinner anchor bolt</strong>\r\n\r\nLuckily, for those of you that happen to run into the issue of having the wrong anchor bolt, don't worry about digging for another set. I found a place that sells just the thicker anchor bolt, since its discontinued from Nissan now..:(\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.z1motorsports.com/240sx/product_info.php?products_id=3784\">http://www.z1motorsports.com/240sx/product_info.php?products_id=3784</a>\r\n\r\nAnyways, I only need the following items in order to finish up and get this thing all bolted on.\r\n\r\n<strong>-Z32 2+2 ebrake cables</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>-Z32 rear calipers</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>-Z32 rear PMU HC+ Pads</strong>\r\n\r\nSo, I'll update you guys again once I get everything finished and bolted up!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>hey everyone,</p>\n\n<p>So, I posted earlier in the summer about my plans to swap out the brakes with yuki.

The fatter one on the right there is only found on the 1990 N/A 300ZX.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this, is that the Z32 hub actually has slightly different spacing in 1990 or lackthereof really, than all the other versions. The Z32 hub has a plate that the anchor bolt goes onto. This rises the anchor bolt about 6mm which accounts for the difference in space over the thicker one. It's a common mistake people have been making when doing 5lug/z32 swaps into their S13's from what i've seen.</p>\n\n<p>let's put all the fact's i've researched into one place. The following is what's needed depending on the hub you're using.</p>\n\n<p><strong>S13 4lug, Ichiba 5lug conversion, R32 GTS-T, Z32 1990 hubs = Thicker anchor bolt</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Z32 91+, S14, R32 GTR hubs = Thinner anchor bolt</strong></p>\n\n<p>Luckily, for those of you that happen to run into the issue of having the wrong anchor bolt, don't worry about digging for another set. I found a place that sells just the thicker anchor bolt, since its discontinued from Nissan now..:(</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.z1motorsports.com/240sx/product_info.php?products_id=3784\">http://www.z1motorsports.com/240sx/product<em>info.php?products</em>id=3784</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I only need the following items in order to finish up and get this thing all bolted on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Z32 2+2 ebrake cables</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-Z32 rear calipers</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>-Z32 rear PMU HC+ Pads</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, I'll update you guys again once I get everything finished and bolted up!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1349610930000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1406551376000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1349610930000,"published_by":1},{"id":1834,"uuid":"5503829c-f3a7-45e6-9ce2-5c7364986175","title":"Japan Trip: Day 11 (Tokyo Tower, more Shibuya and Shinjuku)","slug":"japan-trip-day-11-tokyo-tower-and-shibuya","markdown":"Day 11 was a bit less hectic than previous days, and I was hanging out most of the day with my friend Makoto.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00044.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8630\" title=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00044.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00015.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8628\" title=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFirst on the list of things to do was check out Tokyo Tower!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00075.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8632\" title=\"DSC_0007\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00075.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty awesome view once we got up there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00215.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8643\" title=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_00215.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey had these sections where you could look down at the street below.

But, Hideki helps run the place along with his sister Yukako, who was nice enough to give me some sweets as a present, but could be there to meet me. Also, I forget what the name of this truck was, but it had some pretty sweet bucket seats and looked like it would be fun to try out as a track car!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00661.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9845\" alt=\"DSC_0066\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00661.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of these cuppachino's spotted as well.

The dosing from the turbo totally surprised me! haha check out some video below for the awesome flutter sounds!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1270.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9891\" alt=\"IMG_1270\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1270.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The name of the place was Sayaka I believe, and while the style of hambuger was a little bit raw than what I would like, it was still suuuper good!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1274.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9895\" alt=\"IMG_1274\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1274.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Since I didn't want to rush to Osaka that night, and it would be easier if I just left in the morning. Hideki and Natsuko were kind enough to set me up with a hotel for the night, since his place was too small.  lol <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1277.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9898\" alt=\"IMG_1277\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1277.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I had a blast in shizuoka, and can't wait to come back to visit again!

If I had to compare the two, while both are big cities, Osaka feels a bit more like Seattle, and Tokyo feels more like New York.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9916\" alt=\"DSC_0127\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the way to the subway I noticed this awesome Nissan Truck!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9917\" alt=\"DSC_0128\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is what you're greeted with when you step outside the main entrance from Kyoto Station!

Apparently, this cat cafe is pretty famous! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9922\" alt=\"DSC_0134\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd even though it says no taking pictures...I did anyways. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9921\" alt=\"DSC_0133\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI was actually a bit surprised with how crowded it was on a weekday afternoon.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9925\" alt=\"DSC_0137\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKyoto definitly seems to be a really popular tourist town! It still has that sense of old fashion japanese to it as well.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9929\" alt=\"DSC_0142\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I've always liked is how Japan always has alot of places to just chill and relax even in the cities.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9931\" alt=\"DSC_0144\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nApparently, its a popular date spot as well. heh *insert angry rant about being single here*<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9930\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere's a quick shot at one of the back-alley temples I found.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9933\" alt=\"DSC_0147\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI also was able to check out this famous temple called Yasakajinja.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9936\" alt=\"DSC_0153\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNaturally had to take my tourist-style pic as well with yuka. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9937\" alt=\"DSC_0155\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFarther inside the temple, they had these huge ropes with bells attached to them. According to Yuka, they're for making wishes at. Similar to wishing wells that we have in the US.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9942\" alt=\"DSC_0161\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother intersting thing I ran into, was this sign of bad luck based on certain ages. Luckily, my age of 23 wasn't on there so I don't need to worry. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9940\" alt=\"DSC_0159\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt was starting to get dark, but luckily alot of my pictures ended up turning out alright.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9944\" alt=\"DSC_0163\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs we were walking around looking for a place to eat, we decided to call up another one of our friend's from Seattle to see if he wanted to join us.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9945\" alt=\"DSC_0169\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYuka, our friend Takeshi and I decided to go eat at this Nagoya-style place called Yama-chan. They had some pretty interesting old-school posters outside also. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9966\" alt=\"yama-chan\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe ended up eating some chicken wings, ham katsu(which was AMAZIN), friend rice, and croquettes!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1302\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDesert were these japanese sweet potatoes w/ vanilla ice cream.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9964\" alt=\"IMG_1303\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I spotted this Cop car tucked away in some corner alley. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9946\" alt=\"DSC_0170\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI was actually quite surprised how active Kyoto was at night. It kind of seemed like a tourist area that would only be active during the daytime. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9948\" alt=\"DSC_0173\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI also spotted this wanna-be AKB48 bar. AKB48 is a japanese idol group consisting of 48 girls from Tokyo's Akihabara district. hence the AKB. Osaka/Kyoto have their own version of this called NMB48, which you'll see in a later post! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9949\" alt=\"DSC_0175\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the station I spotted this wierd van slammed on some chrome wheels. It looked really funny in person.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9950\" alt=\"DSC_0176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere you can get a cool reflection of the Kyoto Tower off of the side of Kyoto Station<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9952\" alt=\"DSC_0181\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI'm always amazed at how beautiful Japan is specifically at night.

It was great to catch up with my friend's Yuka and Takeshi and hopefully next time i'll go check out some more stuff like Kinkakujin(golden temple)!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9955\" alt=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\n[gallery ids=\"9966,9965,9964,9963,9962,9961,9960,9959,9958,9957,9956,9955,9954,9953,9952,9951,9950,9949,9948,9947,9946,9945,9944,9943,9942,9941,9940,9939,9938,9937,9936,9935,9934,9933,9932,9931,9930,9929,9928,9927,9926,9925,9924,9923,9922,9921,9920,9919,9918,9917,9916,9915,9914,9913,9912,9911,9910,9909,9908,9907,9906\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>man...a bit late again on these.

If I had to compare the two, while both are big cities, Osaka feels a bit more like Seattle, and Tokyo feels more like New York.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9916\" alt=\"DSC_0127\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0127.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the way to the subway I noticed this awesome Nissan Truck!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9917\" alt=\"DSC_0128\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0128.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is what you're greeted with when you step outside the main entrance from Kyoto Station! Reminds me alot of the Space Needle. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1300.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9962\" alt=\"IMG_1300\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1300.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter, I metup with Yuka, and we started cruising around town. Apparently, this cat cafe is pretty famous! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9922\" alt=\"DSC_0134\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0134.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And even though it says no taking pictures...I did anyways. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9921\" alt=\"DSC_0133\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0133.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I was actually a bit surprised with how crowded it was on a weekday afternoon.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9925\" alt=\"DSC_0137\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0137.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Kyoto definitly seems to be a really popular tourist town! It still has that sense of old fashion japanese to it as well.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9929\" alt=\"DSC_0142\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0142.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I've always liked is how Japan always has alot of places to just chill and relax even in the cities.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9931\" alt=\"DSC_0144\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0144.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, its a popular date spot as well. heh <em>insert angry rant about being single here</em><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9930\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0143.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick shot at one of the back-alley temples I found.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9933\" alt=\"DSC_0147\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0147.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I also was able to check out this famous temple called Yasakajinja.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9936\" alt=\"DSC_0153\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0153.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Naturally had to take my tourist-style pic as well with yuka. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9937\" alt=\"DSC_0155\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0155.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Farther inside the temple, they had these huge ropes with bells attached to them. According to Yuka, they're for making wishes at. Similar to wishing wells that we have in the US.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9942\" alt=\"DSC_0161\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0161.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another intersting thing I ran into, was this sign of bad luck based on certain ages. Luckily, my age of 23 wasn't on there so I don't need to worry. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9940\" alt=\"DSC_0159\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0159.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It was starting to get dark, but luckily alot of my pictures ended up turning out alright.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9944\" alt=\"DSC_0163\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0163.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As we were walking around looking for a place to eat, we decided to call up another one of our friend's from Seattle to see if he wanted to join us.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9945\" alt=\"DSC_0169\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0169.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yuka, our friend Takeshi and I decided to go eat at this Nagoya-style place called Yama-chan. They had some pretty interesting old-school posters outside also. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9966\" alt=\"yama-chan\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yama-chan.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We ended up eating some chicken wings, ham katsu(which was AMAZIN), friend rice, and croquettes!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1302\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1302.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Desert were these japanese sweet potatoes w/ vanilla ice cream.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9964\" alt=\"IMG_1303\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1303.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, I spotted this Cop car tucked away in some corner alley. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9946\" alt=\"DSC_0170\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0170.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I was actually quite surprised how active Kyoto was at night. It kind of seemed like a tourist area that would only be active during the daytime. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9948\" alt=\"DSC_0173\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0173.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I also spotted this wanna-be AKB48 bar. AKB48 is a japanese idol group consisting of 48 girls from Tokyo's Akihabara district. hence the AKB. Osaka/Kyoto have their own version of this called NMB48, which you'll see in a later post! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9949\" alt=\"DSC_0175\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0175.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the way back to the station I spotted this wierd van slammed on some chrome wheels. It looked really funny in person.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9950\" alt=\"DSC_0176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0176.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here you can get a cool reflection of the Kyoto Tower off of the side of Kyoto Station<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9952\" alt=\"DSC_0181\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0181.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I'm always amazed at how beautiful Japan is specifically at night. Especially being in the city, everything looks really cool.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0184.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9953\" alt=\"DSC_0184\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0184.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It was time to head back to Osaka and get some rest before getting up to do some more exploring the next day. It was great to catch up with my friend's Yuka and Takeshi and hopefully next time i'll go check out some more stuff like Kinkakujin(golden temple)!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9955\" alt=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0189.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>[gallery ids=\"9966,9965,9964,9963,9962,9961,9960,9959,9958,9957,9956,9955,9954,9953,9952,9951,9950,9949,9948,9947,9946,9945,9944,9943,9942,9941,9940,9939,9938,9937,9936,9935,9934,9933,9932,9931,9930,9929,9928,9927,9926,9925,9924,9923,9922,9921,9920,9919,9918,9917,9916,9915,9914,9913,9912,9911,9910,9909,9908,9907,9906\"]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1370989165000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719365000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1370989165000,"published_by":1},{"id":1839,"uuid":"fef61d4e-abce-4644-a416-cb459f8d7a79","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 10(Osaka)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-10osaka","markdown":"hey everyone, here's anther post from my japan trip.

We first headed over to Shimbashi in osaka.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0006.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9975\" alt=\"DSC_0006\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0006.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nRight away found the awesome Glico runner who's on a bunch of Pocky boxes and also that I suck at playing copycat! :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9973\" alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0004.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nApparently, this bridge is called nanpa bridge due to the huge amounts of guys from host clubs that try to solicit girls to come hang out at the bar/club at night. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0007.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9976\" alt=\"DSC_0007\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0007.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed about Osaka, is even though it was in the middle of the afternoon on a monday, it still was nowhere near as crowded as tokyo! lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0008.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9977\" alt=\"DSC_0008\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0008.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe signs here are also alot different. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0010.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9979\" alt=\"DSC_0010\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0010.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nApparently, Osaka is home to alot of famous comedians. None of which, I know about. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9980\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter checking out a few places, we decided to stop and grab some Takoyaki, since osaka is famous for it. The Takoyaki i've had here in seattle isn't bad, but doesn't compare at all to the ones here. haha Also, even for a tourist place, food is relatively cheap in japan. 6 of them costed us only $3.50 ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10007\" alt=\"IMG_1310\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe only downside, is when you first get it. You almost always have to wait a good 5 minutes before eating, unless you like scalding the entire insides of your mouth. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10008\" alt=\"IMG_1311\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing Osaka is popular for is their mascot called Billiken. He'sa bit similar to the buhdda, except instead of rubbing his belly for luck, you rub his feet. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9981\" alt=\"DSC_0012\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI did think these semi-indoor malls were pretty near. They stretched for quite a ways too! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9982\" alt=\"DSC_0013\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nManaged to randomly find the NMB48 Theatre! which is basically the Osaka version of Tokyo's popular AKB48 Idol Group.W<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9989\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile venturing around, I noticed this really cool parking garage. Instead of having a big spiral going up like most of the ones in the US, they just use a little crane, and lift the car up onto its proper spot!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9990\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe started to get into the Otaku side of town. Earlier, I was pretty surprised when emiko randomly said \"メイドカフェ行こう！\"(Lets go to a maid cafe!) I had wanted to actually go to one since the last time I visited japan, but walking in my yourself is a bit intimidating. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9991\" alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe ended up going to this place, which was one of the few ones that was open a bit earlier for lunch service! One thing its worth noting about maid cafe's is you're not allowed to take pictures....USUALLY. I went into 007 covert ops mode to take some pics. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9997\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhen we walked in we were greated by this super cute girl in a pikachu themes maid outfit. I'm guessing she's the one who wrote on the sign board above. haha The place started to get super busy a little after we put in our order. So, I felt a bit bad for her. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10009\" alt=\"IMG_1315\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThe menu had standard japanese cafe items like melon soda, cakes, ect.. I decided to go with the standard of Omlete Rice! :p Naturlly, which she drew a pikachu on! haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10010\" alt=\"IMG_1316\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEmiko ended up getting some chocalate cake, which she managed to eat while resisting the urge to destroy her chocolate kitten. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10011\" alt=\"IMG_1317\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing japan is super popular for with gambling is pachinko. They had these huge pachinko parlous everywhere, and this one I thought was pretty interesting since they had some copy of Marlyn Monroe. lol <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9984\" alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother thing I thought was amazing, is this guy's old man stength! 0_o he was able to pull all these stuff around by himself!! lol He's putting homeless people or recycle gather people in the US to SHAME. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9998\" alt=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSadly, after taking some pictures with these random people, emiko had to head off to work. So, I went back to my room for a few hours, before heading out again to meetup with another one of my friends.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9985\" alt=\"DSC_0017\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter taking a short break for a few hours, I headed out again. Only to notice this super sweet 50's style luxury car. Something tells me its a Rolls Royce or a Bentley due to the front, but I'm not completely sure. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10012\" alt=\"IMG_1318\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also spotted this really clean Toyota Prius that was lightly modded.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9993\" alt=\"DSC_0025\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nJust before I got to the subway station, I noticed this super clean BMW just sitting there outside of the rain, wanting its pictures taken. :p So, I kindly obliged. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10001\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10018\" alt=\"DSC_0038\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter meeting up at Osaka Station, our first stop of the afternoon was to go checkout Shinsekai which basically means \"New World\" although, that was a looong time ago, so now its more like.. \"Old World\". haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10003\" alt=\"DSC_0039\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe decided to go check out that huge wield looking tower called Tsutenkaku<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10004\" alt=\"DSC_0040\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce at the top you could see all the different parts of Osaka!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10006\" alt=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts safe to say, I had no clue what I was looking at for the most part. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10005\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10029\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nInside they had this really odd Billiken collection.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10028\" alt=\"DSC_0044\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the way back to the bottom they had some misc shops that features a ton of Glico productions, namely Pocky. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10013\" alt=\"IMG_1320\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\naaand more pocky<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10015\" alt=\"IMG_1323\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\naand the tower made out of Glico snacks. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10014\" alt=\"IMG_1321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the next level things got even wierder. Running into this huge collection of Ultimate Muscle(Kinniku Man) stuff that Megumi started lecturing me on. ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10031\" alt=\"DSC_0047\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI dunno, I think I can take him! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10030\" alt=\"DSC_0046\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also had these life-sized pieces from some of the various characters too.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10032\" alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce we got to the bottom, Megumi suggest we go try some Kansai style food called Kushikatsu. Which, is like regular katsu, but skrewed cabob style. lol It was actually super tastey, and you basically pick the combo you want, and they keep bringing you stuff. It's not very filling, but great for a snack! ^_^\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10016\" alt=\"IMG_1324\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324-e1371410126245.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter checking out Shinsekai, we went back to the main Osaka station to check out this new mall called Grant Front Osaka. Apparently it just opened a week prior.<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10033\" alt=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0049.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n\r\nhere it is, in all its glory. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10034\" alt=\"DSC_0050\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMegumi was actually pretty excited to check it out, since she lives in this area, but hadn't yet been there. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10035\" alt=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe mall is actually split up into two different sides. This being the backside of the above building, which has mostly regular shopping stores. And the other building has mostly food and other types of stores.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10051\" alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick shot from between the buildings down at the street.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0052\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe inside was actually pretty amazing, and it felt like one of the bigger malls you would see in California or something. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10043\" alt=\"DSC_0061\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBut, just alot more levels to it. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10042\" alt=\"DSC_0060\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRight when we stepped outside, there was this really cool bench area where you could sit and hangout at. Sadly, it was raining, so I only enjoyed the view briefly.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0064\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLooks like Osaka also has a ferris wheel, but apparently it doesn't compare to the giant one over in Yokohama.(which I didnt get a chance to visit this time)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10023\" alt=\"DSC_0069\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10048\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nApparently, there was still some ways to go if you really wanted to get to the very top of the second building. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10049\" alt=\"DSC_0071\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the way back we spotted this really cool resteraunt with this pool on the side. Nightlife in japan is really awesome compared to Seattle. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10050\" alt=\"DSC_0076\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFrom the balcony of this resteraunt area, I spotted this corner that looks like it needs some extra tire marks! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10053\" alt=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA quick look at one of the giant department stores next to the mall.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10054\" alt=\"DSC_0080\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOverall while the entire day was exhausting, and a bit wet and damp, I had a great time in Osaka! I'd like to come back again sometime for more than just 2 days to do a bit more exploring. lol Thanks to Megumi, and Eriko for showing me around! Tomorrow, is time to getup super early, and head all the way back north to visit my friend's up in Gunma again! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10052\" alt=\"DSC_0078\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10055,10054,10053,10052,10051,10050,10049,10048,10045,10044,10043,10042,10041,10040,10039,10038,10037,10036,10035,10034,10033,10032,10031,10030,10029,10028,10027,10024,10023,10022,10021,10020,10019,10018,10017,10016,10015,10014,10013,10012,10011,10010,10009,10008,10007,10006,10005,10004,10003,10002,10001,10000,9999,9998,9997,9996,9995,9994,9993,9992,9991,9990,9989,9988,9987,9986,9985,9984,9983,9982,9981,9980,9979,9978,9977,9976,9975,9974,9973,9972,9971\"]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>hey everyone, here's anther post from my japan trip.

None of which, I know about. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9980\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0011.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After checking out a few places, we decided to stop and grab some Takoyaki, since osaka is famous for it. The Takoyaki i've had here in seattle isn't bad, but doesn't compare at all to the ones here. haha Also, even for a tourist place, food is relatively cheap in japan. 6 of them costed us only $3.50 ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10007\" alt=\"IMG_1310\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1310.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The only downside, is when you first get it. You almost always have to wait a good 5 minutes before eating, unless you like scalding the entire insides of your mouth. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10008\" alt=\"IMG_1311\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1311.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing Osaka is popular for is their mascot called Billiken. He'sa bit similar to the buhdda, except instead of rubbing his belly for luck, you rub his feet. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9981\" alt=\"DSC_0012\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0012.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I did think these semi-indoor malls were pretty near. They stretched for quite a ways too! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9982\" alt=\"DSC_0013\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0013.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Managed to randomly find the NMB48 Theatre! which is basically the Osaka version of Tokyo's popular AKB48 Idol Group.W<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9989\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0021.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While venturing around, I noticed this really cool parking garage. Instead of having a big spiral going up like most of the ones in the US, they just use a little crane, and lift the car up onto its proper spot!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9990\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0022.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We started to get into the Otaku side of town. Earlier, I was pretty surprised when emiko randomly said \"メイドカフェ行こう！\"(Lets go to a maid cafe!) I had wanted to actually go to one since the last time I visited japan, but walking in my yourself is a bit intimidating. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9991\" alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0023.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We ended up going to this place, which was one of the few ones that was open a bit earlier for lunch service! One thing its worth noting about maid cafe's is you're not allowed to take pictures....USUALLY. I went into 007 covert ops mode to take some pics. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9997\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0029.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When we walked in we were greated by this super cute girl in a pikachu themes maid outfit. I'm guessing she's the one who wrote on the sign board above. haha The place started to get super busy a little after we put in our order. So, I felt a bit bad for her. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10009\" alt=\"IMG_1315\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1315.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>The menu had standard japanese cafe items like melon soda, cakes, ect.. I decided to go with the standard of Omlete Rice! :p Naturlly, which she drew a pikachu on! haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10010\" alt=\"IMG_1316\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1316.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Emiko ended up getting some chocalate cake, which she managed to eat while resisting the urge to destroy her chocolate kitten. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10011\" alt=\"IMG_1317\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1317.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing japan is super popular for with gambling is pachinko. They had these huge pachinko parlous everywhere, and this one I thought was pretty interesting since they had some copy of Marlyn Monroe. lol <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9984\" alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0015.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another thing I thought was amazing, is this guy's old man stength! 0_o he was able to pull all these stuff around by himself!! lol He's putting homeless people or recycle gather people in the US to SHAME. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9998\" alt=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0030.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Sadly, after taking some pictures with these random people, emiko had to head off to work. So, I went back to my room for a few hours, before heading out again to meetup with another one of my friends.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9985\" alt=\"DSC_0017\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0017.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After taking a short break for a few hours, I headed out again. Only to notice this super sweet 50's style luxury car. Something tells me its a Rolls Royce or a Bentley due to the front, but I'm not completely sure. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10012\" alt=\"IMG_1318\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1318.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I also spotted this really clean Toyota Prius that was lightly modded.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9993\" alt=\"DSC_0025\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0025.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Just before I got to the subway station, I noticed this super clean BMW just sitting there outside of the rain, wanting its pictures taken. :p So, I kindly obliged. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10001\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0035.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10018\" alt=\"DSC_0038\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0038.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After meeting up at Osaka Station, our first stop of the afternoon was to go checkout Shinsekai which basically means \"New World\" although, that was a looong time ago, so now its more like.. \"Old World\". haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10003\" alt=\"DSC_0039\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0039.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We decided to go check out that huge wield looking tower called Tsutenkaku<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10004\" alt=\"DSC_0040\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0040.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once at the top you could see all the different parts of Osaka!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10006\" alt=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0042.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its safe to say, I had no clue what I was looking at for the most part. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10005\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0041.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10029\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0045.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Inside they had this really odd Billiken collection.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10028\" alt=\"DSC_0044\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0044.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the way back to the bottom they had some misc shops that features a ton of Glico productions, namely Pocky. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10013\" alt=\"IMG_1320\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1320.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>aaand more pocky<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10015\" alt=\"IMG_1323\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1323.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>aand the tower made out of Glico snacks. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10014\" alt=\"IMG_1321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1321.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the next level things got even wierder. Running into this huge collection of Ultimate Muscle(Kinniku Man) stuff that Megumi started lecturing me on. ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10031\" alt=\"DSC_0047\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0047.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I dunno, I think I can take him! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10030\" alt=\"DSC_0046\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0046.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They also had these life-sized pieces from some of the various characters too.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10032\" alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0048.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once we got to the bottom, Megumi suggest we go try some Kansai style food called Kushikatsu. Which, is like regular katsu, but skrewed cabob style. lol It was actually super tastey, and you basically pick the combo you want, and they keep bringing you stuff. It's not very filling, but great for a snack! ^_^ <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10016\" alt=\"IMG_1324\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1324-e1371410126245.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After checking out Shinsekai, we went back to the main Osaka station to check out this new mall called Grant Front Osaka. Apparently it just opened a week prior.<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10033\" alt=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0049.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></p>\n\n<p>here it is, in all its glory. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10034\" alt=\"DSC_0050\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0050.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Megumi was actually pretty excited to check it out, since she lives in this area, but hadn't yet been there. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10035\" alt=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0051.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The mall is actually split up into two different sides. This being the backside of the above building, which has mostly regular shopping stores. And the other building has mostly food and other types of stores.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10051\" alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick shot from between the buildings down at the street.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0052\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0052.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The inside was actually pretty amazing, and it felt like one of the bigger malls you would see in California or something. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10043\" alt=\"DSC_0061\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0061.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>But, just alot more levels to it. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10042\" alt=\"DSC_0060\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0060.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Right when we stepped outside, there was this really cool bench area where you could sit and hangout at. Sadly, it was raining, so I only enjoyed the view briefly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0064\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0064.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Looks like Osaka also has a ferris wheel, but apparently it doesn't compare to the giant one over in Yokohama.(which I didnt get a chance to visit this time)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10023\" alt=\"DSC_0069\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0069.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10048\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Apparently, there was still some ways to go if you really wanted to get to the very top of the second building. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10049\" alt=\"DSC_0071\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0071.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the way back we spotted this really cool resteraunt with this pool on the side. Nightlife in japan is really awesome compared to Seattle. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10050\" alt=\"DSC_0076\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0076.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>From the balcony of this resteraunt area, I spotted this corner that looks like it needs some extra tire marks! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10053\" alt=\"DSC_0079\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0079.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A quick look at one of the giant department stores next to the mall.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10054\" alt=\"DSC_0080\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0080.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Overall while the entire day was exhausting, and a bit wet and damp, I had a great time in Osaka! I'd like to come back again sometime for more than just 2 days to do a bit more exploring. lol Thanks to Megumi, and Eriko for showing me around! Tomorrow, is time to getup super early, and head all the way back north to visit my friend's up in Gunma again! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10052\" alt=\"DSC_0078\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0078.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10055,10054,10053,10052,10051,10050,10049,10048,10045,10044,10043,10042,10041,10040,10039,10038,10037,10036,10035,10034,10033,10032,10031,10030,10029,10028,10027,10024,10023,10022,10021,10020,10019,10018,10017,10016,10015,10014,10013,10012,10011,10010,10009,10008,10007,10006,10005,10004,10003,10002,10001,10000,9999,9998,9997,9996,9995,9994,9993,9992,9991,9990,9989,9988,9987,9986,9985,9984,9983,9982,9981,9980,9979,9978,9977,9976,9975,9974,9973,9972,9971\"]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1371384774000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719364000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1371384774000,"published_by":1},{"id":1840,"uuid":"1d68b24b-e77f-4d9e-9284-8b99496bcc47","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 11 in Gunma (Crayon, Complete Garage Re-Sanai and Menya-Gekkou)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-11-in-gunma-crayon-complete-garage-re-sanai-and-menya-gekkou","markdown":"With the Kansai section of my trip finished, it was time to catch the long train ride back up to tokyo, and then up to gunma!

I tried to convince him to open up a branch over here, but with had no luck. ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10106\" alt=\"DSC_0003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe even makes things like these awesome tarts!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10105\" alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI ended up getting the Mocha, Custard, and Chocolate flavored puddings, as well as a milk tea, and vanilla ice cream with caramel ontop. The puddings, while small, are surprisingly filling! &gt;&lt; I was done by the second one, but managed to put it all down. Another thing I noticed, is when you order milk tea in japan, they let you add your own creamer and sweetener!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10103\" alt=\"DSC_0006\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter waiting for him to finish up a meeting, he agreed to take me out for a spin in his rx-7 touge monster sporting around 650hp! Those wanting to see more pictures of this car can check out my post from last year <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/2012/05/japan-trip-day-2-gunma-adventures/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00071.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10102\" alt=\"DSC_0007\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00071.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere's a video down below of the ride-along. However, it was a bit damp out, so Okada-san was being a bit cautious to not really let it open. Next time, hopefully I can ride along during a dry day! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10100\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat's the face of one man in the ZONE, and another one who's VERY tired. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10099\" alt=\"DSC_0013\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe inside of this car is strictly business, as you can see form the racepack cluster, and stripped out interior. lol Another thing that put a huge smile on my face, was hearing the massive HKS T04 turbo spool up. can't wait to get my SR going so I can hear the same sound. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10101\" alt=\"DSC_0009\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter saying goodbye to the delicious pudding shop, Eichi and I headed over to the shop to wait for our friend Asuka so we could go and eat at a local ramen shop that Eichi and his girlfriend Emi know the owners of.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10098\" alt=\"DSC_0018\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlong the way we spotted this clean Toyota Celica!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10275\" alt=\"IMG_1337\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile waiting, I decided it would be cool to do another small photoshoot. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10096\" alt=\"DSC_0020\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis time around, there are only a couple cars outside. Since last year, Eichi has gotten another job which has taken up a majority of his time. So, now the shop is open for appointment only.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10095\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBut, that still doesn't stop me from enjoying the awesome-ness of this place!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10093\" alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts kind of funny there's this tiny shop way out in gunma, but nobody would be expecting...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10091\" alt=\"DSC_0026\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA monster time attack FD lurking behind its walls driven by the one and only Tarzan Yamada himself! Apparently, the only thing wrong with the car, is the fuel pump setup isn't working. The engine itself which is puts out around 500hp I believe, it still in working condition. Eichi said that until somebody fixes it, it probably wont ever see the track again, since he just doesn't have the time for it. I've volunteered to save this car from such a cruel fate if I ever get the chance! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10079\" alt=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis was a new addition since last time, a super clean FB!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10094\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI'm still amazed at how well japanese people keep care of their cars. This interior literally smelled and looked brand new!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10082\" alt=\"DSC_0039\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe car only had around 100km on the odometer to boot!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10080\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nInside on the table was this familiar cutaway from last time...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10090\" alt=\"DSC_0028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nand some stickers, along with the new Vaka-mon(tarzan yama) sticker set. Eichi was nice enough to give me one as a present, but I still haven't figured out where I want to stick it yet. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10089\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMoving into the other garage, was this green FB from last time, still in great condition!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10088\" alt=\"DSC_0031\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nand also still rocking the original carburetor!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10084\" alt=\"DSC_0036\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMoving on was this super clean RX-2 that I belive was there last time as well<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10087\" alt=\"DSC_0032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis one was sporting some aftermarket carbs, which were oriented pretty cool. They should make some super long velocity stacks, and do a cutaway on the hood to make them stick out. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10086\" alt=\"DSC_0033\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA close-up of the 12-a motor that both of these cars run.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10085\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYou gotta have alot of respect for Mazda for being different back in the day, and coming up with something they can really call their own. While I've never actually had the chance to own a rotary, I do have alot of respect for them.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10083\" alt=\"DSC_0038\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381-e1371593396536.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I found out when I arrived in Takasaki on my way to Maebashi, is a ton of these guys called Daruma. Apparently Takasaki is where they originated from. The goal of these little guys, is to paint half of the face, then finish it once you've accomplished whatever goal it is you set out for.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that caught my eye this time was this cool Tomika book dedicated to rotaries that Re-Sanai was featured in!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\non the way out of the shop, spotted some Advan tires, and turbo goodies<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10078\" alt=\"DSC_0043\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShops like Re-Sanai and people like Eichi are one of the reasons I really love japan. I can't wait to come back and help him resurrect that Yellow FD! ;) haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10092\" alt=\"DSC_0024\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter meeting up with Asuka, we headed about 20 minutes down the road to visit this Ramen shop. Of course, I made sure to keep my open for things like this S14 drifter along the way. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10074\" alt=\"DSC_0050\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI finally was able to make it and try this awesome ramen from the shop calld <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/menya.gekkou117\" target=\"_blank\">Men-ya Gekkou</a>. Which by far, was the best i've ever tasted in my life. I liked it so much, I was actually given a second helping of noodles on the house, even though its not normally offered! ^_^ Pictured below is my standard choice of Miso Chashu.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10073\" alt=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10072\" alt=\"DSC_0052\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhen ordering, most Ramen places, and some other food places use these ticket machines. So, you need to buy the ticket first, then give it to the employee.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10276\" alt=\"IMG_1339\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt actually had a really cool feel to it, which seemed different from other ramen places I've visited. It was cool to see this huge painting of Seattle native Jimi Henrix!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10071\" alt=\"DSC_0053\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLuckily, when we came it was a bit late on a weekday night, so the rush was pretty much gone.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10070\" alt=\"DSC_0054\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI want to thank Ai and Yuya for completely blowing my mind with some great tasting ramen! It was Asuka's first time as well and she was also really impressed.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10069\" alt=\"DSC_0055\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI'll for sure be coming back here to eat on my next trip to Gunma!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10068\" alt=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne the way to go meetup with Emi, this super clean Subaru was spotted, and the guy even waved back. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10067\" alt=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEichii actually had a bunch of work to catch up on for the following day. So, he busted out the laptop to get some work done while we waited for his girlfriend Emi to show up at this shabu-shabu resteraunt.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10065\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591-e1371594437417.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne thing I thought was really interesting, is that they always leave the plastic on the top end of your straw so it doesn't get contaminated! haha I don't really care either way, but still its nice to have I guess.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10278\" alt=\"IMG_1341\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt was my first time having this, and while I was still full from ramen, it was still really tasty! You basically take the various vegetables, and put it into the hotpot over to the left....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10064\" alt=\"DSC_0061\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nthen you take the mean, and let it simme for maybe 30 seconds in the broth.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10063\" alt=\"DSC_0062\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter that, it was time to head back home. I then realized I had completely forgotten to do my laundy. So, I headed over to a neary laundry mat, and watched the thing go around and around. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10280\" alt=\"IMG_1343\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe following morning it was time for me to do the final leg of my trip, and head back to tokyo for the next 3 days. It was great visiting everyone up in Gunma, meeting new people and I can't wait to go back there again!

One thing I noticed that's different from last year, is this huge row of solar panels they installed. It's always neat to see rural places use higher technology like this to make things cheaper and better for the environment!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10108\" alt=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00011.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We had some time to kill before meeting up with other people, so once again we headed over to our friend Okada-san's Pudding shop called <a href=\"http://www.crayon2007.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crayon</a>!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00051.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10104\" alt=\"DSC_0005\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00051.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>He makes everythign from pudding, to cookies, to cool drinks to enjoy during the summertime. It's really too bad we don't have one of these here in Seattle. I tried to convince him to open up a branch over here, but with had no luck. ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10106\" alt=\"DSC_0003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00031.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>He even makes things like these awesome tarts!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10105\" alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00041.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I ended up getting the Mocha, Custard, and Chocolate flavored puddings, as well as a milk tea, and vanilla ice cream with caramel ontop. The puddings, while small, are surprisingly filling! &gt;&lt; I was done by the second one, but managed to put it all down. Another thing I noticed, is when you order milk tea in japan, they let you add your own creamer and sweetener!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10103\" alt=\"DSC_0006\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00061.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After waiting for him to finish up a meeting, he agreed to take me out for a spin in his rx-7 touge monster sporting around 650hp!

However, it was a bit damp out, so Okada-san was being a bit cautious to not really let it open. Next time, hopefully I can ride along during a dry day! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10100\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00111.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>That's the face of one man in the ZONE, and another one who's VERY tired. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10099\" alt=\"DSC_0013\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00131.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The inside of this car is strictly business, as you can see form the racepack cluster, and stripped out interior. lol Another thing that put a huge smile on my face, was hearing the massive HKS T04 turbo spool up. can't wait to get my SR going so I can hear the same sound. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10101\" alt=\"DSC_0009\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00091.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After saying goodbye to the delicious pudding shop, Eichi and I headed over to the shop to wait for our friend Asuka so we could go and eat at a local ramen shop that Eichi and his girlfriend Emi know the owners of.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10098\" alt=\"DSC_0018\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00181.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Along the way we spotted this clean Toyota Celica!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10275\" alt=\"IMG_1337\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1337.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While waiting, I decided it would be cool to do another small photoshoot. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10096\" alt=\"DSC_0020\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00201.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This time around, there are only a couple cars outside. Since last year, Eichi has gotten another job which has taken up a majority of his time. So, now the shop is open for appointment only.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10095\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00211.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>But, that still doesn't stop me from enjoying the awesome-ness of this place!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10093\" alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its kind of funny there's this tiny shop way out in gunma, but nobody would be expecting...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10091\" alt=\"DSC_0026\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A monster time attack FD lurking behind its walls driven by the one and only Tarzan Yamada himself! Apparently, the only thing wrong with the car, is the fuel pump setup isn't working. The engine itself which is puts out around 500hp I believe, it still in working condition. Eichi said that until somebody fixes it, it probably wont ever see the track again, since he just doesn't have the time for it. I've volunteered to save this car from such a cruel fate if I ever get the chance! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10079\" alt=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00421.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This was a new addition since last time, a super clean FB!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10094\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00221.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I'm still amazed at how well japanese people keep care of their cars. This interior literally smelled and looked brand new!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10082\" alt=\"DSC_0039\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The car only had around 100km on the odometer to boot!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10080\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00411.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Inside on the table was this familiar cutaway from last time...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10090\" alt=\"DSC_0028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00281.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>and some stickers, along with the new Vaka-mon(tarzan yama) sticker set. Eichi was nice enough to give me one as a present, but I still haven't figured out where I want to stick it yet. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10089\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00291.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving into the other garage, was this green FB from last time, still in great condition!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10088\" alt=\"DSC_0031\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00311.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>and also still rocking the original carburetor!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10084\" alt=\"DSC_0036\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00361.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving on was this super clean RX-2 that I belive was there last time as well<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10087\" alt=\"DSC_0032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This one was sporting some aftermarket carbs, which were oriented pretty cool. They should make some super long velocity stacks, and do a cutaway on the hood to make them stick out. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10086\" alt=\"DSC_0033\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0033.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A close-up of the 12-a motor that both of these cars run.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10085\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>You gotta have alot of respect for Mazda for being different back in the day, and coming up with something they can really call their own. While I've never actually had the chance to own a rotary, I do have alot of respect for them.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10083\" alt=\"DSC_0038\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00381-e1371593396536.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I found out when I arrived in Takasaki on my way to Maebashi, is a ton of these guys called Daruma. Apparently Takasaki is where they originated from. The goal of these little guys, is to paint half of the face, then finish it once you've accomplished whatever goal it is you set out for.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00481.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that caught my eye this time was this cool Tomika book dedicated to rotaries that Re-Sanai was featured in!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00491.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>on the way out of the shop, spotted some Advan tires, and turbo goodies<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10078\" alt=\"DSC_0043\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00431.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Shops like Re-Sanai and people like Eichi are one of the reasons I really love japan. I can't wait to come back and help him resurrect that Yellow FD! ;) haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10092\" alt=\"DSC_0024\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00241.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After meeting up with Asuka, we headed about 20 minutes down the road to visit this Ramen shop. Of course, I made sure to keep my open for things like this S14 drifter along the way. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10074\" alt=\"DSC_0050\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00501.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I finally was able to make it and try this awesome ramen from the shop calld <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/menya.gekkou117\" target=\"_blank\">Men-ya Gekkou</a>. Which by far, was the best i've ever tasted in my life. I liked it so much, I was actually given a second helping of noodles on the house, even though its not normally offered! ^_^ Pictured below is my standard choice of Miso Chashu.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10073\" alt=\"DSC_0051\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00511.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10072\" alt=\"DSC_0052\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00521.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When ordering, most Ramen places, and some other food places use these ticket machines. So, you need to buy the ticket first, then give it to the employee.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10276\" alt=\"IMG_1339\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1339.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It actually had a really cool feel to it, which seemed different from other ramen places I've visited. It was cool to see this huge painting of Seattle native Jimi Henrix!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10071\" alt=\"DSC_0053\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00531.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Luckily, when we came it was a bit late on a weekday night, so the rush was pretty much gone.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10070\" alt=\"DSC_0054\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00541.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I want to thank Ai and Yuya for completely blowing my mind with some great tasting ramen! It was Asuka's first time as well and she was also really impressed.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10069\" alt=\"DSC_0055\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00551.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I'll for sure be coming back here to eat on my next trip to Gunma!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10068\" alt=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00561.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One the way to go meetup with Emi, this super clean Subaru was spotted, and the guy even waved back. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10067\" alt=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00571.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Eichii actually had a bunch of work to catch up on for the following day. So, he busted out the laptop to get some work done while we waited for his girlfriend Emi to show up at this shabu-shabu resteraunt.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10065\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00591-e1371594437417.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One thing I thought was really interesting, is that they always leave the plastic on the top end of your straw so it doesn't get contaminated! haha I don't really care either way, but still its nice to have I guess.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10278\" alt=\"IMG_1341\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1341.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It was my first time having this, and while I was still full from ramen, it was still really tasty! You basically take the various vegetables, and put it into the hotpot over to the left....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10064\" alt=\"DSC_0061\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00611.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>then you take the mean, and let it simme for maybe 30 seconds in the broth.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10063\" alt=\"DSC_0062\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00621.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After that, it was time to head back home. I then realized I had completely forgotten to do my laundy. So, I headed over to a neary laundry mat, and watched the thing go around and around. :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10280\" alt=\"IMG_1343\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1343.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The following morning it was time for me to do the final leg of my trip, and head back to tokyo for the next 3 days. It was great visiting everyone up in Gunma, meeting new people and I can't wait to go back there again!

Here you can really see how packed it is at the famous Shibuya Crossing near the Hacihko statue.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00661.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0066\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00661.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nyou can see how popular of a meetup spot this is. One thing I found that helps, is being very specific in the meetup spot. For example, in this case I said at the hachiko statue, infront of the green train. This makes it alot easier for people to find you and vice-versa! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0067.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0067\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0067.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter meeting up with Kosuke, we went off to grab some Curry for breakfast.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00701.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0070\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00701.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is the haamburger curry breakfast. Most times when you order food, you can specify Omori(big portion). I'm glad they offer this, since sometimes regular meals aren't enough for me. Also, another thing that's pretty cool is most places always give you miso soup with your meal.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1350.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10291\" alt=\"IMG_1350\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1350.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we made our way across town to go check out Harajuku. One thing that's really nice,especially in the city is how smooth the roads are! Next time I come here, I'm for sure going to bring my skateboard to get around instead of walking. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00711.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0071\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00711.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHaving some of these sections with shade proved a nice relief from the sun!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0073.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0073\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0073.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that sort of caught me off guard  was this free public wifi! Usually you need to go to a coffee shop or something, so this is something I think would be really cool to implement in other countries!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0074.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0074\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0074.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce at Harajuku, this familiar Ford Fiesta was spotted!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0075.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0075\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0075.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTurns out Ken Block is hosting a gymhana event going on in Odaiba soon, so the jdm monster girls, and the rest of the monster team were out promoting and hanging out free drinks.

But, the name of the program I believe was Super News.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1354.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10285\" alt=\"IMG_1354\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1354.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter gabbing some bubble tea, we headed over to the train station to part ways. It was great seeing him again, and I can't wait to visit again!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0088.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0088\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0088.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLater that afternoon I metup with my friend Teppei to have dinner, and explore some sections of Ginza!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0092.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0092\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0092.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I still can't quite get over is how awesome Japan, and Toko specifically is at night.

For our troubles, we were given some free sushi! Also, its worth noting how cheap the sushi is!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0120.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0120\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0120.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also took a risk, and decided to try a Natto roll. I don't rally mind Natto itself, but the sushi was actually really good!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01221.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0122\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01221.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that also is pretty neat is most sushi places will give you green tea after your meal!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01231.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0123\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting sushi, we called it a night, and headed out at Shimbashi station. One downside to taking the train in tokyo late at night, is they stop at midnight. So, getting on the train, Especially the Yamanote line around 11-12 is always a chore from it being crazy crowded. &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0104.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0104\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0104.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe following day was the last one I had to be in tokyo, so I made some plans to grab food, and do some shopping for friends.","html":"<p>Day 13 I had much more energy after getting a power nap and some extra sleep. lol The weather was awesome and I mostly did a bunch of exploring with friends.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00771.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00771.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>First up for the day  was for to  meetup with my friend Kosuke and do some exploring around Shibuya. Here you can really see how packed it is at the famous Shibuya Crossing near the Hacihko statue.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00661.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0066\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00661.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>you can see how popular of a meetup spot this is. One thing I found that helps, is being very specific in the meetup spot. For example, in this case I said at the hachiko statue, infront of the green train. This makes it alot easier for people to find you and vice-versa! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0067.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0067\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0067.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After meeting up with Kosuke, we went off to grab some Curry for breakfast.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00701.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0070\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00701.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This is the haamburger curry breakfast. Most times when you order food, you can specify Omori(big portion). I'm glad they offer this, since sometimes regular meals aren't enough for me. Also, another thing that's pretty cool is most places always give you miso soup with your meal.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1350.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10291\" alt=\"IMG_1350\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1350.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After breakfast we made our way across town to go check out Harajuku. One thing that's really nice,especially in the city is how smooth the roads are! Next time I come here, I'm for sure going to bring my skateboard to get around instead of walking. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00711.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0071\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00711.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Having some of these sections with shade proved a nice relief from the sun!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0073.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0073\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0073.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that sort of caught me off guard  was this free public wifi! Usually you need to go to a coffee shop or something, so this is something I think would be really cool to implement in other countries!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0074.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0074\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0074.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once at Harajuku, this familiar Ford Fiesta was spotted!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0075.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0075\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0075.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Turns out Ken Block is hosting a gymhana event going on in Odaiba soon, so the jdm monster girls, and the rest of the monster team were out promoting and hanging out free drinks. Something tells me people like that alot better than pointless tissues. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00771.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_00771.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A quick shot of one of the main popular streets in Harajuku. Sadly, this was a weekday. So, not much was going on during the day. :\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0082.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0082\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0082.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>another thing I noticed in japan is some wierd store names...this one i'm not sure why its called happy room, but it kinda makes me want to go there. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0086.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0086\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0086.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It was pretty hot out, so we decided to stop off in this cafe callded Pearl Lady to grab some bubble tea.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1353.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1353\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1353.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Little did we know, Fuji TV was actually shooting for their afternoon news segment! 0_o</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10282\" alt=\"IMG_1351\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>At first I was kind of excited that my drink would be on national TV!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1352.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10283\" alt=\"IMG_1352\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1352.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>But then, just like these two high school girls, Me and Kosuke were actually interviewed...in Japanese! 0_o Luckily I didn't mess anything up, but the TV staff were pretty amazed I was able to listen and reply to questions in japanese. lol Sadly, my friend didn't record the show, so I don't have any footage of it. But, the name of the program I believe was Super News.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1354.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10285\" alt=\"IMG_1354\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1354.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After gabbing some bubble tea, we headed over to the train station to part ways. It was great seeing him again, and I can't wait to visit again!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0088.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0088\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0088.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Later that afternoon I metup with my friend Teppei to have dinner, and explore some sections of Ginza!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0092.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0092\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0092.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I still can't quite get over is how awesome Japan, and Toko specifically is at night.

So, getting on the train, Especially the Yamanote line around 11-12 is always a chore from it being crazy crowded. &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0104.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0104\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0104.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The following day was the last one I had to be in tokyo, so I made some plans to grab food, and do some shopping for friends.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1372003710000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719364000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1372003710000,"published_by":1},{"id":1843,"uuid":"437c78bf-09dd-4108-83f2-f37777cf29a8","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 14 ( Shibuya, Wangan and Daikokufuto)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-14-shibuya-wangan-and-daikokufuto","markdown":"Day 14 was my last day in Tokyo and man was it ever a long one.

It was actually pretty nice weather out, but my phone was being wierd.

This is the same one featured in the Speedhunters article <a href=\"http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/05/chocolate-nissans-more-japan-hobbyhunting/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Sadly, there wasn't really very many interesting things this time..:\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10306\" alt=\"IMG_1373\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI then took the train over a few stops to Akihabara to go check out Yodabashi Camera to see what other goodies they have. It's a bit wierd having big stores like this be on 8 or 9 Floors, instead of one or 2 huge ones like in the US. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10307\" alt=\"IMG_1374\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis time, there were plenty of interesting Tomika models to drool over!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10308\" alt=\"IMG_1375\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nfor example, they even had ones like this Toyota 86(Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10333\" alt=\"IMG_1376\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI then made my way over to the Hobby section, and was blown away how many awesome models they had!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10310\" alt=\"IMG_1378\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSome of you might have noticed this awesome Senna model. I was really close to buying it, but it was a bit pricey at 54 bucks. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10313\" alt=\"IMG_1381\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMoving down the line they had some other awesome cars like this R31 with...Michael Bay explosions..? and a sweet N2 Toyota AE86.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10311\" alt=\"IMG_1379\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNaturally, they also had some Itasha models as well!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10314\" alt=\"IMG_1382\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also had some more expensive Die Cast models, but these were even more expensive ranging from $50-$500! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10312\" alt=\"IMG_1380\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother thing I wanted to snap a quick picture of, is in japan, they use booth babes for EVERYTHING. It's kind of awesome. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1383.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10315\" alt=\"IMG_1383\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1383.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter doing some shopping, I had some time to kill before more Shenanigans that were going to take place that day. This Tropicana grapefruit soda was AMAZING! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1384.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10316\" alt=\"IMG_1384\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1384.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMy friend Kensaku(ken) was nice enough to drive all the way out to Meguro from Kakegawa to hang out! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01241.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10160\" alt=\"DSC_0124\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01241.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe went to find a parking spot nearby, and went to get some food since he hadn't eaten dinner yet.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10161\" alt=\"DSC_0126\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01261.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe ended up going into this place that had AMAZING tonkatsu. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01271.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10162\" alt=\"DSC_0127\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01271.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI had the Black Pepper, and Garlic pieces, which I would later regret....alot...\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1387.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10319\" alt=\"IMG_1387\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1387.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso, the rice came in these cool wooden containers!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1386.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10318\" alt=\"IMG_1386\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1386.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tonkatsu.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10226\" alt=\"tonkatsu\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tonkatsu.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting food, we decided to hitup the Roppongi area since I didn't quite get time to go over there yet. While driving around this Ferrari 458 Italia was spotted!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10163\" alt=\"DSC_0130\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI kinda found this bumper sticker funny, and this sort of thing is rare in japan on regular cars. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10164\" alt=\"DSC_0131\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother shot of downtown Roppongi<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10165\" alt=\"DSC_0132\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts hard to believe that this girl actually had the same pace as us throughout the city for about 10-15 minutes. We kept getting stuck at red lights, and she would catch up to us on her bike. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10166\" alt=\"DSC_0133\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI felt like I was back in California for a second when I spotted this old school lowrider with underglow!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10167\" alt=\"DSC_0135\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe then went over to cruise through the red light district, when we spotted one of his friend's cars. Apparently he likes to go there pretty often. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10168\" alt=\"DSC_0136\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe made a short pitstop somewhere in tokyo(I forget the name), so Ken could pickup some contract thing from one of his co-workers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10169\" alt=\"DSC_0139\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile the contract exchange was going on, this pretty clean Mark II Chaser with BBS wheels pulled out from the alley infront of us. haha Its such a shame we don't have awesome 2JZ 4-door cars in the US..:(<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10170\" alt=\"DSC_0140\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBy this time it was already around 1am, but I kind of wanted to go back to check out Daikokufuto again. So, we hopped in the Kei car beast, got on the legendary C1 Loop to do some late night wangan runs!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10171\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI'm still blown away at how smooth these roads are even after 20+ years of people racing on them. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10173\" alt=\"DSC_0146\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThose of you who have plated Tokyo Extreme Racer, or other japanese racing games know how annoying, but also useful these lane seperators can be. Its worth noting shoving another car into these in real life at 300km/h is probably not a very good idea. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10175\" alt=\"DSC_0151\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nhmm...stay on the C1 loop, or hitup the legendary Wangan/BayShore route...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10178\" alt=\"DSC_0156\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe decided to hop off the C1, and head towards Daikoku. Along the way, we ran into this super popular tunnel that's been featured many times in various Option videos like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wbabFQeY2ro?t=2m10s\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10186\" alt=\"DSC_0176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that really jumped out at me, is why Ken kept putting his hand on his visor from time-to-time. Turns out, that when speed cameras take pictures, they MUST have a picture of your license plate AND your face. If you hide you face, they can't legally give you the ticket!!! much nicer than here in the US. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10187\" alt=\"DSC_0177\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe finally arrived at Daikokufuto, but decided to do some scouting around on the outer areas to see if there was any drifting going on. Years back, ken used to go drifting here alot, so we went to check out some old spots he knew of.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10192\" alt=\"DSC_0190\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe noticed this modified scooter, which looked pretty  cool<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10194\" alt=\"DSC_0194\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso spotted another Mark II Chaser<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10196\" alt=\"DSC_0196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe kept finding cars scattered here and there, but no real action going on.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10198\" alt=\"DSC_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe stopped off at a small convenience store to grab some snacks, and decide whether to give up an head back to daikoku, or do some more exploring. By this time, it was already almos 2am, and I had to wake up in another 3 hours. &gt;&lt; Apparently, there was a big accident recently in the area when a car was drifting and slammed into a big crowd of people, killing a few. so, they moved on to some other areas. :\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10199\" alt=\"DSC_0199\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe followed around this R33 Skyline for a bit, before heading back over to daikoku<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10201\" alt=\"DSC_0207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYet another skyline spotted! Its kind of funny how common they are over here compared to the couple that we have over in Seattle.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10202\" alt=\"DSC_0208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile it wasn't quite as crowded this time even though it was a saturday night, there were still plenty of interesting cars to check out. One of them being this Peugot or Citroen that had a huuge wing. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10203\" alt=\"DSC_0209\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's the R32 that we spotted a few pictures above!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10204\" alt=\"DSC_0210\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were a small group of FD's also gathered around. All of them were pretty clean too!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10206\" alt=\"DSC_0213\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis red one I especially thought looked awesome.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10208\" alt=\"DSC_0215\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOff in the corner was this guy in another FD doing some quick tuning on his laptop, before heading out for some more wangan runs I assume. I chatted with him for a bit, bit he didn't seem to be in the mood. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10210\" alt=\"DSC_0217\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne car that was REALLY unexpected was this Mclaren MP4-12C!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10212\" alt=\"DSC_0220\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts hard to describe how amazing this car looks and sounds in person!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10213\" alt=\"DSC_0221\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA par of these nice Supras were also found off in the corner.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10214\" alt=\"DSC_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt some point, I really would love to ride in one of these guys!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10215\" alt=\"DSC_0223\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOddly enough, just as we were leaving was first time seeing a R34 during this trip! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10218\" alt=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I didn't realize was that they turn the lights off on Tokyo Tower after midnight in order to save power. By this time it was already 3am, and I needed to get some kind of sleep before Derek came banging on my hotel door at 6am. lol I can't wait to get back out to the Wangan in a proper car, and do some high speed runs! ^_^  Huge thanks to Ken for driving around everywhere, and coming out to Tokyo to meetup!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10219\" alt=\"DSC_0229\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10339,10338,10337,10336,10335,10334,10333,10332,10331,10330,10329,10328,10327,10326,10325,10324,10323,10322,10321,10320,10319,10318,10317,10316,10315,10314,10313,10312,10311,10310,10309,10308,10307,10306,10304,10303,10302,10301,10300,10299,10298,10297,10296,10295,10226,10219,10218,10217,10216,10215,10214,10213,10212,10211,10210,10209,10208,10207,10206,10205,10204,10203,10202,10201,10200,10199,10198,10197,10196,10195,10194,10193,10192,10191,10190,10189,10188,10187,10186,10185,10184,10183,10182,10181,10180,10179,10178,10177,10176,10175,10174,10173,10172,10171,10170,10169,10168,10167,10166,10165,10164,10163,10162,10161,10160\"]","html":"<p>Day 14 was my last day in Tokyo and man was it ever a long one.

This is the same one featured in the Speedhunters article <a href=\"http://www.speedhunters.com/2013/05/chocolate-nissans-more-japan-hobbyhunting/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Sadly, there wasn't really very many interesting things this time..:\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10306\" alt=\"IMG_1373\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1373.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I then took the train over a few stops to Akihabara to go check out Yodabashi Camera to see what other goodies they have. It's a bit wierd having big stores like this be on 8 or 9 Floors, instead of one or 2 huge ones like in the US. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10307\" alt=\"IMG_1374\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1374.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This time, there were plenty of interesting Tomika models to drool over!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10308\" alt=\"IMG_1375\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1375.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>for example, they even had ones like this Toyota 86(Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10333\" alt=\"IMG_1376\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_13761.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I then made my way over to the Hobby section, and was blown away how many awesome models they had!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10310\" alt=\"IMG_1378\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1378.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some of you might have noticed this awesome Senna model. I was really close to buying it, but it was a bit pricey at 54 bucks. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10313\" alt=\"IMG_1381\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1381.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving down the line they had some other awesome cars like this R31 with...Michael Bay explosions..? and a sweet N2 Toyota AE86.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10311\" alt=\"IMG_1379\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1379.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Naturally, they also had some Itasha models as well!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10314\" alt=\"IMG_1382\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1382.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They also had some more expensive Die Cast models, but these were even more expensive ranging from $50-$500! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10312\" alt=\"IMG_1380\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1380.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another thing I wanted to snap a quick picture of, is in japan, they use booth babes for EVERYTHING.

While driving around this Ferrari 458 Italia was spotted!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10163\" alt=\"DSC_0130\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0130.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I kinda found this bumper sticker funny, and this sort of thing is rare in japan on regular cars. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10164\" alt=\"DSC_0131\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01311.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another shot of downtown Roppongi<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10165\" alt=\"DSC_0132\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its hard to believe that this girl actually had the same pace as us throughout the city for about 10-15 minutes. We kept getting stuck at red lights, and she would catch up to us on her bike. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10166\" alt=\"DSC_0133\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01331.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I felt like I was back in California for a second when I spotted this old school lowrider with underglow!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10167\" alt=\"DSC_0135\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We then went over to cruise through the red light district, when we spotted one of his friend's cars. Apparently he likes to go there pretty often. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10168\" alt=\"DSC_0136\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01361.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We made a short pitstop somewhere in tokyo(I forget the name), so Ken could pickup some contract thing from one of his co-workers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10169\" alt=\"DSC_0139\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While the contract exchange was going on, this pretty clean Mark II Chaser with BBS wheels pulled out from the alley infront of us. haha Its such a shame we don't have awesome 2JZ 4-door cars in the US..:(<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10170\" alt=\"DSC_0140\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0140.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By this time it was already around 1am, but I kind of wanted to go back to check out Daikokufuto again. So, we hopped in the Kei car beast, got on the legendary C1 Loop to do some late night wangan runs!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10171\" alt=\"DSC_0143\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01431.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I'm still blown away at how smooth these roads are even after 20+ years of people racing on them. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10173\" alt=\"DSC_0146\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01461.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Those of you who have plated Tokyo Extreme Racer, or other japanese racing games know how annoying, but also useful these lane seperators can be. Its worth noting shoving another car into these in real life at 300km/h is probably not a very good idea. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10175\" alt=\"DSC_0151\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0151.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>hmm...stay on the C1 loop, or hitup the legendary Wangan/BayShore route...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10178\" alt=\"DSC_0156\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0156.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We decided to hop off the C1, and head towards Daikoku. Along the way, we ran into this super popular tunnel that's been featured many times in various Option videos like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/wbabFQeY2ro?t=2m10s\" target=\"_blank\">this one</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10186\" alt=\"DSC_0176\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01761.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that really jumped out at me, is why Ken kept putting his hand on his visor from time-to-time. Turns out, that when speed cameras take pictures, they MUST have a picture of your license plate AND your face. If you hide you face, they can't legally give you the ticket!!! much nicer than here in the US. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10187\" alt=\"DSC_0177\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01771.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We finally arrived at Daikokufuto, but decided to do some scouting around on the outer areas to see if there was any drifting going on. Years back, ken used to go drifting here alot, so we went to check out some old spots he knew of.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10192\" alt=\"DSC_0190\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_01901.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We noticed this modified scooter, which looked pretty  cool<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10194\" alt=\"DSC_0194\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0194.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also spotted another Mark II Chaser<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10196\" alt=\"DSC_0196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0196.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We kept finding cars scattered here and there, but no real action going on.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10198\" alt=\"DSC_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0198.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We stopped off at a small convenience store to grab some snacks, and decide whether to give up an head back to daikoku, or do some more exploring. By this time, it was already almos 2am, and I had to wake up in another 3 hours. &gt;&lt; Apparently, there was a big accident recently in the area when a car was drifting and slammed into a big crowd of people, killing a few. so, they moved on to some other areas. :\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10199\" alt=\"DSC_0199\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0199.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We followed around this R33 Skyline for a bit, before heading back over to daikoku<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10201\" alt=\"DSC_0207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0207.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Yet another skyline spotted! Its kind of funny how common they are over here compared to the couple that we have over in Seattle.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10202\" alt=\"DSC_0208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0208.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While it wasn't quite as crowded this time even though it was a saturday night, there were still plenty of interesting cars to check out. One of them being this Peugot or Citroen that had a huuge wing. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10203\" alt=\"DSC_0209\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0209.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's the R32 that we spotted a few pictures above!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10204\" alt=\"DSC_0210\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0210.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There were a small group of FD's also gathered around. All of them were pretty clean too!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10206\" alt=\"DSC_0213\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0213.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This red one I especially thought looked awesome.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10208\" alt=\"DSC_0215\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0215.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Off in the corner was this guy in another FD doing some quick tuning on his laptop, before heading out for some more wangan runs I assume. I chatted with him for a bit, bit he didn't seem to be in the mood. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10210\" alt=\"DSC_0217\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0217.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One car that was REALLY unexpected was this Mclaren MP4-12C!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10212\" alt=\"DSC_0220\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0220.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its hard to describe how amazing this car looks and sounds in person!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10213\" alt=\"DSC_0221\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0221.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A par of these nice Supras were also found off in the corner.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10214\" alt=\"DSC_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0222.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>At some point, I really would love to ride in one of these guys!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10215\" alt=\"DSC_0223\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0223.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Oddly enough, just as we were leaving was first time seeing a R34 during this trip! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10218\" alt=\"DSC_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0226.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I didn't realize was that they turn the lights off on Tokyo Tower after midnight in order to save power. By this time it was already 3am, and I needed to get some kind of sleep before Derek came banging on my hotel door at 6am. lol I can't wait to get back out to the Wangan in a proper car, and do some high speed runs! ^_^  Huge thanks to Ken for driving around everywhere, and coming out to Tokyo to meetup!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10219\" alt=\"DSC_0229\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0229.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10339,10338,10337,10336,10335,10334,10333,10332,10331,10330,10329,10328,10327,10326,10325,10324,10323,10322,10321,10320,10319,10318,10317,10316,10315,10314,10313,10312,10311,10310,10309,10308,10307,10306,10304,10303,10302,10301,10300,10299,10298,10297,10296,10295,10226,10219,10218,10217,10216,10215,10214,10213,10212,10211,10210,10209,10208,10207,10206,10205,10204,10203,10202,10201,10200,10199,10198,10197,10196,10195,10194,10193,10192,10191,10190,10189,10188,10187,10186,10185,10184,10183,10182,10181,10180,10179,10178,10177,10176,10175,10174,10173,10172,10171,10170,10169,10168,10167,10166,10165,10164,10163,10162,10161,10160\"]</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1372009901000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719439000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1372009901000,"published_by":1},{"id":1844,"uuid":"13d49d0c-c73e-438d-a5d4-ee0833263a11","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 15/Final (Idler's at Tsukuba Circuit)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-15final-idlers-at-tsukuba-circuit","markdown":"So finally my last day of the trip arrived, and I really didn't want to leave.

But, when I got back home, I realized all of the pictures I had THOUGHT copied over, were all corrupted...T_T\r\n\r\nAnyways, the day started off with Derek coming by and picking me up in this SWEET Nissan Largo! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10350\" alt=\"DSC_0231\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10419\" alt=\"IMG_1388\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt even came with a KA24DE!! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10420\" alt=\"IMG_1389\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting some breakfest we setup on the 2hour drive from Tokyo to Tsukuba Circuit.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10351\" alt=\"DSC_0232\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSome of you who read my posts from the last trip, probably recognize this building. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10352\" alt=\"DSC_0233\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe also drove by the giant Skytree Tower<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10353\" alt=\"DSC_0234\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile on the road we spotted one of the Eneos fuel trucks<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10354\" alt=\"DSC_0235\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso was one of those tricked out japanese 18 wheelers. lol I forget what they're called though.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10355\" alt=\"DSC_0236\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nJust like last time there's plent of small tuning shops with awesome cars scattered outside the track, such as this Audi.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10356\" alt=\"DSC_0238\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter parking and walking towards the track, we spotted Hideki's trailer!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10357\" alt=\"DSC_0239\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts pretty cool since its a double decker, but the best part of it....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10358\" alt=\"DSC_0240\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nyes, even their trailer truck has bucket seats and a harness! haha if you'll recall there was a little Nissan pickup that I thought was interesting because it had bucket seats in it.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10359\" alt=\"DSC_0241\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso spotted was this awesome official Tsukuba Circuit S15 Pace Car!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10360\" alt=\"DSC_0243\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce entering the circuit pit area that awesome feeling came over me where I still couldn't quite believe I was here at Tsukuba for Idlers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10361\" alt=\"DSC_0244\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also think its cool they provide these small gas stations on the track. I noticed this last year at Fuji speedway, and again here at Tsukuba. It makes it much easier than having to make a run miles away. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0297\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of Derek's friend's Ben and his wife who run a car importing business in Canada also came along. When we first entered, we immediatly were drawn to the new purple RWB creation.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10362\" alt=\"DSC_0245\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis thing is simple amazing, and you can see its creator Nakai-san catching a quick nap over in the corner.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10364\" alt=\"DSC_0248\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEven Derek agrees that huge double stacked wings make for great way to escape the heat! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10368\" alt=\"DSC_0253\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts also pretty cool how the turbo is just hanging off the back like that. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10367\" alt=\"DSC_0252\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMoving on, we ventured further down into the pits, and ran into some surprises...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10371\" alt=\"DSC_0256\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLike this little Honda<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10373\" alt=\"DSC_0258\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\na super clean Z<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10375\" alt=\"DSC_0260\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThat was driven by this kid. haha just kidding :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10382\" alt=\"DSC_0269\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nand for the first time, I saw a TVR in person. This thing is...beautiful!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10377\" alt=\"DSC_0262\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe interior was also amazing on this car. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10380\" alt=\"DSC_0266\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\noh yeah, and we can't forget this massive V8 under the hood<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10381\" alt=\"DSC_0267\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere was also this super rare Austin Martin.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10386\" alt=\"DSC_0274\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNot sure why, but this official Idlers porsche reminds me of a Hot Wheels car. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10388\" alt=\"DSC_0277\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe spotted a section with a bunch of 86's and figured Hideki was among them somewhere.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10390\" alt=\"DSC_0279\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes we spotted his car and eventually him.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10391\" alt=\"DSC_0280\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think its safe to say Ben doesn't fit in these very well. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10392\" alt=\"DSC_0282\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick shot of the engine bay. The one thing i've always liked about cars in japan, is their simplicity.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10394\" alt=\"DSC_0284\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI turned my attention to the car infornt of his, and noticed it also had a Garage Miura sticker on it...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10393\" alt=\"DSC_0283\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nTurns out his dad(Yasuhiro-san) also enjoy's driving 86's around the track and has been racing 86's and other cars for around 30 years.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10398\" alt=\"DSC_0288\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHis dad's setup was running this new blacktop 4AG swap, so we was a bit unsure of how the car would perform.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10397\" alt=\"DSC_0287\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe car was still running a parial interior, but just by looking at the cluster you can tell its a racecar first and foremost. Also, it doesn't seem like his dog liked me hanging around, so we moved on to check out some other stuff. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10404\" alt=\"DSC_0295\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were also a bunch of these mini-f1 cars that were called Formula Kei<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10401\" alt=\"DSC_0292\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, they were actually running SR engines! 0_o also, anybody spot the Williams replica paintjob in the corner?<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10400\" alt=\"DSC_0291\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI think its safe to say, porsche's dominated the attendance at this event. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10403\" alt=\"DSC_0294\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nI thought it was funny how almost everybody was in the pits, and not in the grandstands. That means, more people actually went to the pits to check out cars, and interact with the drivers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1390\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter the first Qualifying session where hideki managed to lock up 7th, we headed into the cafeteria to get lunch. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10422\" alt=\"IMG_1391\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nExcuse the horrible photo, but it was actually pretty corded in there, but the AC felt reaaaly good. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10423\" alt=\"IMG_1392\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI ended up eating the some Gyudon and miso soup.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10424\" alt=\"IMG_1393\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile we were eating, plentyof other classes were still going, and the track was pretty much being used almost all day long!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10418\" alt=\"DSC_0328\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile I was on vacation, I realized I didn't take any pictures of my comapny's mascot Roger the robot. So, I figured this was a good chance to snap a few while I had all my things with me. This is also a good section to mention, I totally missed getting almost all of the action pictures since they were part of the corrupted batch I mentioned earlier...T_T<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0302\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI'm going to have to skip ahead towards the end since I don't have any shots really after this point. Hideki ended up with a GREAT start in the race to pull up to 5th, but tire wear caught up to him, and he fell back to 7th place in the end. He had won this race in the past in 2010 and again in 2012. But, he still had some awesome driving to keep the 2 guys off of him for most of the race, and really pumped me up to go do some driving of my own! I'll include some videos of his Qualifying and Race at the bottom of the post.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10412\" alt=\"DSC_0321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHideki also introduced me to one of his Friend's Suzuki-san from the shop <a href=\"http://2106power.blog21.fc2.com\" target=\"_blank\">Orange Planning</a> ended up qualifying 1st, and managed to hold off the other car for almost the entire race to take the win.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10411\" alt=\"DSC_0319\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSadly, I don't have any pictures of his car..T_T but the setup for his engine was pretty interesting as It used a combination of different toyota engines, such as an AE101 bottom end.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10413\" alt=\"DSC_0323\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey had people get up on the podium and pose for pictures and whatnot shortly before. Before the race, Suzuki-san joked that if he won I can just take his place on the podium. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10410\" alt=\"DSC_0309\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother thing I thoguth was pretty neat, is they also get a picture of all drivers who participated in the race.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10414\" alt=\"DSC_0324\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter doing the ceremonies, it was time to go through the pits and cleanup.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10426\" alt=\"IMG_1395\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe best thing about owning hatch backs, is how much stuff you can cram back there. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10427\" alt=\"IMG_1396\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter packing up, I grabbed something cool to drink and to keep me awake. haha This latte I bought was AMAZING. one thing that threw me off is with japanese vending machines, some give you the option for cold or hot drinks. I wasn't paying attention and accidentally ordered the hot one which I later gave to somebody. lol d<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10425\" alt=\"IMG_1394\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, I look pretty tired. So, I managed to hitch a ride on the back hatch back to the parking lot area. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10429\" alt=\"IMG_1398\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe whole time this guy in the truck seemed to have a good laugh at my hanging off the back of this loaded up 86. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10428\" alt=\"IMG_1397\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter a few short minutes we passed through this tunnel underneath turn one. Hopefully, I'll get to see Tsukuba Circuit again, but as a driver instead! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10407\" alt=\"DSC_0298\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile outside on the parking lot we also spotted this super awesome rally style Evo.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10430\" alt=\"IMG_1399\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOverall, it was hot, but I had a great time visiting Tsukuba again and can't wait to go back!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10431\" alt=\"IMG_1400\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDerek and Ben ended up leaving part way throughout the day. But, Wataru and Azusa were nice enough to give me a ride all the way to Haneda Airport even though they live here near Tochigi. Its also worth noting Natsuko and her friend who's name I forget also came out to cheer on Hideki. &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10432\" alt=\"IMG_1401\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe loaded up the in DoriNeko Mobile....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10433\" alt=\"IMG_1402\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd caused shenanigans the whole way there! haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10434\" alt=\"IMG_1403\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce we got the the airport, it was only around 7pm, and my flight wasn't until midnight.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10436\" alt=\"IMG_1405\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey didn't have anything going on that night, so they were hanging out with me in the airport until my flight. Haneda is actually a really nice airport, and its location is smack dab in the middle of tokyo.\r\n\r\nI totally forget what this was called, but it was rice with egg and pork...I think. lol its about 3 weeks after as I write this so I can't quite remember. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10439\" alt=\"IMG_1409\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore heading off to go check in, we made a stop at the Hello Kitty store, and were a bit surprised with some of the things we found...0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10440\" alt=\"IMG_1410\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter checking my bags in, and parting with everyone, my Japan trip was finally coming to a close sadly. The one thing I took away from this trip, is that Japan really is AWESOME. If given the chance, I would LOVE to live here. I can't wait to come back, perhaps i'll come back a bit sooner than waiting an entire year again. lol Hopefully you guys enjoyed these posts! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1408\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIts worth noting, I had such an itch to do some racing from watching hideki and everyone else race, that as soon as I got off my plane, I dropped my bags off at home, and headed straight for the Go-Kart track! haha\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1zN07ozo8qI\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_s8bU_rjqrI\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10350,10351,10352,10353,10354,10355,10356,10357,10358,10359,10360,10361,10362,10363,10364,10365,10366,10367,10368,10369,10370,10371,10372,10373,10374,10375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"]","html":"<p>So finally my last day of the trip arrived, and I really didn't want to leave. Luckily, I had saved some of the most fun for last, and headed back up to Tsukuba Circuit for the day to Cheer on Hideki and his AE86 participate in Idler's Games! ^_^</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1400\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>First off, I'd like to kick myself in the butt, for not verifying some pictures trasnferred over to my laptop before deleting them off the SD card. &gt;&lt; I had borrowed one from Hideki to use while I had my go-pro footage recording so I could still take pictures. But, when I got back home, I realized all of the pictures I had THOUGHT copied over, were all corrupted...T_T</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, the day started off with Derek coming by and picking me up in this SWEET Nissan Largo! <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10350\" alt=\"DSC_0231\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0231.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10419\" alt=\"IMG_1388\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1388.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It even came with a KA24DE!! 0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10420\" alt=\"IMG_1389\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1389.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After getting some breakfest we setup on the 2hour drive from Tokyo to Tsukuba Circuit.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10351\" alt=\"DSC_0232\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0232.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some of you who read my posts from the last trip, probably recognize this building. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10352\" alt=\"DSC_0233\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0233.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We also drove by the giant Skytree Tower<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10353\" alt=\"DSC_0234\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0234.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While on the road we spotted one of the Eneos fuel trucks<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10354\" alt=\"DSC_0235\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0235.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also was one of those tricked out japanese 18 wheelers. lol I forget what they're called though.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10355\" alt=\"DSC_0236\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0236.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Just like last time there's plent of small tuning shops with awesome cars scattered outside the track, such as this Audi.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10356\" alt=\"DSC_0238\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0238.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After parking and walking towards the track, we spotted Hideki's trailer!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10357\" alt=\"DSC_0239\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0239.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its pretty cool since its a double decker, but the best part of it....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10358\" alt=\"DSC_0240\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0240.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>yes, even their trailer truck has bucket seats and a harness! haha if you'll recall there was a little Nissan pickup that I thought was interesting because it had bucket seats in it.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10359\" alt=\"DSC_0241\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0241.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also spotted was this awesome official Tsukuba Circuit S15 Pace Car!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10360\" alt=\"DSC_0243\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0243.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once entering the circuit pit area that awesome feeling came over me where I still couldn't quite believe I was here at Tsukuba for Idlers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10361\" alt=\"DSC_0244\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0244.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I also think its cool they provide these small gas stations on the track. I noticed this last year at Fuji speedway, and again here at Tsukuba. It makes it much easier than having to make a run miles away. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0297\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0297.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One of Derek's friend's Ben and his wife who run a car importing business in Canada also came along. When we first entered, we immediatly were drawn to the new purple RWB creation.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10362\" alt=\"DSC_0245\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0245.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This thing is simple amazing, and you can see its creator Nakai-san catching a quick nap over in the corner.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10364\" alt=\"DSC_0248\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0248.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Even Derek agrees that huge double stacked wings make for great way to escape the heat! haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10368\" alt=\"DSC_0253\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0253.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its also pretty cool how the turbo is just hanging off the back like that. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10367\" alt=\"DSC_0252\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0252.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Moving on, we ventured further down into the pits, and ran into some surprises...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10371\" alt=\"DSC_0256\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0256.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Like this little Honda<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10373\" alt=\"DSC_0258\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0258.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>a super clean Z<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10375\" alt=\"DSC_0260\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0260.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>That was driven by this kid. haha just kidding :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10382\" alt=\"DSC_0269\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0269.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>and for the first time, I saw a TVR in person. This thing is...beautiful!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10377\" alt=\"DSC_0262\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0262.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The interior was also amazing on this car. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10380\" alt=\"DSC_0266\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0266.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>oh yeah, and we can't forget this massive V8 under the hood<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10381\" alt=\"DSC_0267\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0267.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There was also this super rare Austin Martin.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10386\" alt=\"DSC_0274\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0274.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Not sure why, but this official Idlers porsche reminds me of a Hot Wheels car. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10388\" alt=\"DSC_0277\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0277.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We spotted a section with a bunch of 86's and figured Hideki was among them somewhere.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10390\" alt=\"DSC_0279\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0279.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After a few minutes we spotted his car and eventually him.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10391\" alt=\"DSC_0280\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0280.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I think its safe to say Ben doesn't fit in these very well. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10392\" alt=\"DSC_0282\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0282.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick shot of the engine bay. The one thing i've always liked about cars in japan, is their simplicity.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10394\" alt=\"DSC_0284\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0284.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I turned my attention to the car infornt of his, and noticed it also had a Garage Miura sticker on it...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10393\" alt=\"DSC_0283\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0283.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Turns out his dad(Yasuhiro-san) also enjoy's driving 86's around the track and has been racing 86's and other cars for around 30 years.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10398\" alt=\"DSC_0288\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0288.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>His dad's setup was running this new blacktop 4AG swap, so we was a bit unsure of how the car would perform.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10397\" alt=\"DSC_0287\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0287.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The car was still running a parial interior, but just by looking at the cluster you can tell its a racecar first and foremost. Also, it doesn't seem like his dog liked me hanging around, so we moved on to check out some other stuff. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10404\" alt=\"DSC_0295\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0295.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There were also a bunch of these mini-f1 cars that were called Formula Kei<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10401\" alt=\"DSC_0292\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0292.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To my surprise, they were actually running SR engines! 0_o also, anybody spot the Williams replica paintjob in the corner?<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10400\" alt=\"DSC_0291\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0291.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I think its safe to say, porsche's dominated the attendance at this event. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10403\" alt=\"DSC_0294\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0294.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>I thought it was funny how almost everybody was in the pits, and not in the grandstands. That means, more people actually went to the pits to check out cars, and interact with the drivers.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1390\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1390.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After the first Qualifying session where hideki managed to lock up 7th, we headed into the cafeteria to get lunch. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10422\" alt=\"IMG_1391\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1391.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Excuse the horrible photo, but it was actually pretty corded in there, but the AC felt reaaaly good. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10423\" alt=\"IMG_1392\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1392.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I ended up eating the some Gyudon and miso soup.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10424\" alt=\"IMG_1393\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1393.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While we were eating, plentyof other classes were still going, and the track was pretty much being used almost all day long!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10418\" alt=\"DSC_0328\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0328.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While I was on vacation, I realized I didn't take any pictures of my comapny's mascot Roger the robot. So, I figured this was a good chance to snap a few while I had all my things with me. This is also a good section to mention, I totally missed getting almost all of the action pictures since they were part of the corrupted batch I mentioned earlier...T_T<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0302\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0302.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to have to skip ahead towards the end since I don't have any shots really after this point. Hideki ended up with a GREAT start in the race to pull up to 5th, but tire wear caught up to him, and he fell back to 7th place in the end. He had won this race in the past in 2010 and again in 2012. But, he still had some awesome driving to keep the 2 guys off of him for most of the race, and really pumped me up to go do some driving of my own! I'll include some videos of his Qualifying and Race at the bottom of the post.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10412\" alt=\"DSC_0321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Hideki also introduced me to one of his Friend's Suzuki-san from the shop <a href=\"http://2106power.blog21.fc2.com\" target=\"_blank\">Orange Planning</a> ended up qualifying 1st, and managed to hold off the other car for almost the entire race to take the win.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10411\" alt=\"DSC_0319\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0319.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Sadly, I don't have any pictures of his car..T_T but the setup for his engine was pretty interesting as It used a combination of different toyota engines, such as an AE101 bottom end.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10413\" alt=\"DSC_0323\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0323.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They had people get up on the podium and pose for pictures and whatnot shortly before. Before the race, Suzuki-san joked that if he won I can just take his place on the podium. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10410\" alt=\"DSC_0309\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0309.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another thing I thoguth was pretty neat, is they also get a picture of all drivers who participated in the race.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10414\" alt=\"DSC_0324\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0324.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After doing the ceremonies, it was time to go through the pits and cleanup.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10426\" alt=\"IMG_1395\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1395.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The best thing about owning hatch backs, is how much stuff you can cram back there. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10427\" alt=\"IMG_1396\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1396.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After packing up, I grabbed something cool to drink and to keep me awake. haha This latte I bought was AMAZING. one thing that threw me off is with japanese vending machines, some give you the option for cold or hot drinks. I wasn't paying attention and accidentally ordered the hot one which I later gave to somebody. lol d<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10425\" alt=\"IMG_1394\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1394.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As you can tell, I look pretty tired. So, I managed to hitch a ride on the back hatch back to the parking lot area. :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10429\" alt=\"IMG_1398\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1398.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The whole time this guy in the truck seemed to have a good laugh at my hanging off the back of this loaded up 86. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10428\" alt=\"IMG_1397\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1397.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After a few short minutes we passed through this tunnel underneath turn one. Hopefully, I'll get to see Tsukuba Circuit again, but as a driver instead! ;)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10407\" alt=\"DSC_0298\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_0298.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While outside on the parking lot we also spotted this super awesome rally style Evo.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10430\" alt=\"IMG_1399\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1399.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Overall, it was hot, but I had a great time visiting Tsukuba again and can't wait to go back!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10431\" alt=\"IMG_1400\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1400.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Derek and Ben ended up leaving part way throughout the day. But, Wataru and Azusa were nice enough to give me a ride all the way to Haneda Airport even though they live here near Tochigi. Its also worth noting Natsuko and her friend who's name I forget also came out to cheer on Hideki. &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10432\" alt=\"IMG_1401\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1401.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We loaded up the in DoriNeko Mobile....<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10433\" alt=\"IMG_1402\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1402.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And caused shenanigans the whole way there! haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10434\" alt=\"IMG_1403\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1403.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once we got the the airport, it was only around 7pm, and my flight wasn't until midnight.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10436\" alt=\"IMG_1405\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1405.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They didn't have anything going on that night, so they were hanging out with me in the airport until my flight. Haneda is actually a really nice airport, and its location is smack dab in the middle of tokyo.</p>\n\n<p>I totally forget what this was called, but it was rice with egg and pork...I think. lol its about 3 weeks after as I write this so I can't quite remember. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10439\" alt=\"IMG_1409\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1409.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Before heading off to go check in, we made a stop at the Hello Kitty store, and were a bit surprised with some of the things we found...0_o<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10440\" alt=\"IMG_1410\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1410.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After checking my bags in, and parting with everyone, my Japan trip was finally coming to a close sadly. The one thing I took away from this trip, is that Japan really is AWESOME. If given the chance, I would LOVE to live here. I can't wait to come back, perhaps i'll come back a bit sooner than waiting an entire year again. lol Hopefully you guys enjoyed these posts! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_1408\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1408.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Its worth noting, I had such an itch to do some racing from watching hideki and everyone else race, that as soon as I got off my plane, I dropped my bags off at home, and headed straight for the Go-Kart track! haha</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1zN07ozo8qI\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_s8bU_rjqrI\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n<p>[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10350,10351,10352,10353,10354,10355,10356,10357,10358,10359,10360,10361,10362,10363,10364,10365,10366,10367,10368,10369,10370,10371,10372,10373,10374,10375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"]</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1372189710000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719438000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1372189710000,"published_by":1},{"id":1845,"uuid":"f843a9ef-4c8a-46e4-a0b1-e5372c821dd6","title":"Japan Trip 2.0: Day 4 (Nikko Circuit)","slug":"japan-trip-2-0-day-4-nikko-circuit","markdown":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nRecently Alexi Smith over at <a href=\"http://noriyaro.com\" target=\"_blank\">Nori Yaro</a> told me there was a Wind's Auto drift day going on at Nikko Circuit. So, I decided to make the 2.5hr trip up there for the first time to check it out! It's worth noting before I start, that halfway throughout the even, I realized my camera settings were totally jacked up. &gt;&lt; so, some of the pictures came out wayy too light. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0481.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9616\" alt=\"DSC_0481\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0481.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAt first I really didn't feel like going just because I had previously went to the same area in Tochigi for Tsukuba just a few days earlier. But, then I remembered how much crap I would've gotten had I not gone. :p So, I grabbed a few things at the convenience store before heading out in the morning. On thing I noticed is that the Pringles here in japan taste totally different! they're less salty. My friend Shunji in seattle is ALWAYS buying pringles, so I guess thats why. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9709\" alt=\"IMG_1207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207-e1369444714318.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI started off with taking the shinkansen from Tokyo Station. Turns out I had about 30minutes to kill before my train, so I did a bit of exploring outside the station.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9463\" alt=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere was this cool courtyard area with small waterfalls that I ran into.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9472\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI didn't want to wander too far, so I just posted up on this street corner to see if I could snap any cool things that drove by. :p Sadly, there was nothing that exciting, and after a while I made my way back to the train station.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9476\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I always forget to take pictures of are these JR ticket machines. They're really easy to use in both japanese and english. You can also recharge your SUICA card here, which is basically like a rechargable card. I finally decided to get one this time around, and its much easier than dealing with a bunch of tickets.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9483\" alt=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIf I haven't already mentioned it....there's a TON of people here in tokyo. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9484\" alt=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInside the station, they have another special gate for the shinkansen, with people to help you out so you don't end up on the wrong train or something. lol\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9486\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter being on the train for a couple hours, I finally arrived at Utsunomiya, and was suprised with how many taxi's were lined up outside. Luckily, I happened to pick the perfect one!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9490\" alt=\"DSC_0065\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I had a great conversation with Yama-san about various things about the US and Japan. He was even nice enough to cut my fare off early, and I only paid part of what I was really supposed to! ^_^ Between the shinkansen and the taxi fare I was supposed to pay, you're looking at around $100 just to get to Nikko Circuit. Sadly, Yama-san doesn't use facebook, or mail or anything, but hopefully he enjoys reading this! Also, he recently had a baby 3 months ago, so congratulations to him!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9492\" alt=\"DSC_0067\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhen I first walked into the area, I was a bit shocked to believe I was actually AT Nikko. The one thing I also enjoyed, is unlike events in the US. It's FREE to come and hangout in the pits, and watch the event. You only pay if you're going to be driving. Also, the prices on food/dinks weren't hiked up, and were actually super cheap.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9493\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis super clean Nismo styled 180 caught my attention\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9494\" alt=\"DSC_0069\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso, here's one of the Wind's Auto owned R32's\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9497\" alt=\"DSC_0072\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\na quick shot looking back on the part of the pit area\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9498\" alt=\"DSC_0073\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere certainly were some unusual drift cars out there today, like this SW20. He also had some pretty amusing stickers which you can catch out farther down below!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00771.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9499\" alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00771.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere this EVO was getting in some AWD drifting action. It was really wierd watching this car drift since there was hardly any countersteer, even though he had the angle. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0087.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9501\" alt=\"DSC_0087\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0087.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso, this D1 machines from Thailand was tearing it up all day long!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01461.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9519\" alt=\"DSC_0146\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01461.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhoever was driving this chaser also drove like his life depended on it. Some of the \"mantries\" these guys take going into this first corner is nuts!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01561.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9521\" alt=\"DSC_0156\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_01561.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also spotted this Missle Chaser from the shop Tokonatsu Factory!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02491.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9529\" alt=\"DSC_0249\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02491.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also really loved the kit on this type-x S13 that looks like it was also participating in Tsuchiya's new series The Drift Muscle\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0252.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9532\" alt=\"DSC_0252\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0252.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAlso, I unexpectedly spotted Daigo Saito just chillin along the pit wall. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02541.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9534\" alt=\"DSC_0254\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02541.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to tell in this picture, but the paint on this S15 was super epic with a ton of pearl in it. lol\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0255.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9535\" alt=\"DSC_0255\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0255.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMore awesome angle from this D1 machine was was making well over 1000HP with a built up 2JZ motor.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02631.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9541\" alt=\"DSC_0263\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_02631.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSince there was a short break in the middle of the day, I decided to take some scenery pics with no cars on the track.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0270.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9543\" alt=\"DSC_0270\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0270.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0271.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9544\" alt=\"DSC_0271\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0271.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0272.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9545\" alt=\"DSC_0272\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0272.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving I actually ran into Andy and Emily Grey from Powervehicles! Andy and Team Orange Driver Naoto Suenaga are the ones who gave me pointers when I attended the Team Orange Drift School last year! For this interested in that post, it can be found <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/2012/05/japan-trip-day-3team-orange-drift-school-ebisu-circuit/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0277.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9550\" alt=\"DSC_0277\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0277.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSadly, Andy's white chaser ran into a powersteering issue earlier in the day, so he had to retire. Luckily, Emilys blue one was still up and running strong. So, I was able to get some ride along footage with her at the bottom of this post!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0351\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0349\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0791\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that I noticed on alot of the cars, especially S-chassis, was the very simple mods. Brakes were pretty much stock, with upgraded pads. However, the one thing I did notice, is people actually spent money on quality parts like JIC, DG5, Tomei, ProjectMu, ect.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9552\" alt=\"DSC_0280\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis s14 took me back to the early 2000's for some reason. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9560\" alt=\"DSC_0303\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThese 86's sounded super awesome flying by as well. It's funny when you stop and think that these only have 1.6L compared to the 2.xL of other motors like RB's, JZ's, ad SR's out on the track.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9566\" alt=\"DSC_0321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nquick shot back at the entrance area\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9576\" alt=\"DSC_0350\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis pretty clean Bilstein 86 was also doing some laps. Although it seemed like he wasn't going very hard on it. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9585\" alt=\"DSC_0371\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nJust because it's a new car, that doesn't stop some people though apparently! 0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9586\" alt=\"DSC_0372\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile I was on my way to go watfch some more action from the other side of the track, some body came pulling up with their bumper dragging along....\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9592\" alt=\"DSC_0393\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\noh hey, look! It's Daigo Saito just trearing up Chaser Missle's as usual. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0395.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9593\" alt=\"DSC_0395\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0395.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShortly after, it looked like somebody spilled oil on the track. So, all of the drivers went out to help cleanup the mess. This is the one big difference I notice even on Drift Tengoku videos. In the US, we had set corner workers that do this, and the drivers end up just relaxing. But, its kind of nice to see most of the drivers all pitching in to do their part in fixing up the track.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9595\" alt=\"DSC_0397\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also had this mini street sweeper thing come in to spread out some of the powder, which is used to suck up some of the oil spilled on the track.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9597\" alt=\"DSC_0401\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfterwards, it seemed like the track turned into a rally stage! 0_o\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9598\" alt=\"DSC_0402\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEven though they could barely see anything, people were charging flat out into the first corner!! haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9600\" alt=\"DSC_0409\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSome people like this guy were even getting some nice weight transfer going on before the flick to get it sideways.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9604\" alt=\"DSC_0423\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShortly after, these guys started getting some pretty good tandem battles going lap after lap\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9614\" alt=\"DSC_0465\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI noticed this SW20/MR2 pulled into the pits, so I went to take a picture of its awesome Pedo Bear sticker. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9615\" alt=\"DSC_0478\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey also started getting some good drift trains going on with daigo leading the pack.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9620\" alt=\"DSC_0486\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nExcept someting looked a tad off....but I couldn't quite figure out what it was... :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9625\" alt=\"DSC_0505\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nShortly after, the MR2 also joined in on the fun\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9629\" alt=\"DSC_0522\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI didn't catch this miata running much, but it seemed really simple and well done.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9630\" alt=\"DSC_0527\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere Emily and Andy go out for another sesstion. It was really interesting riding in her car. It feels soo different compared to drifting my s13. Due to the amount of weight, and wheelbase, and how you can see the suspensio is setup with a really slow rebound in the rear, it had a really nice squat to it when going through the corner. This also gave it a ton of front grip as well it felt like. I can see why alot of D1 setups have been switching to using something similar like this now!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9634\" alt=\"DSC_0537\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnother quick shot from the front of this Drift Muscle 180!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9642\" alt=\"DSC_0567\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nEmily using some front brake action on corner entry!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0584.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9645\" alt=\"DSC_0584\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0584.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMore of the usual, This Toyota Altezza just eating pavement for lunch breakfast and dinner! &gt;&lt;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0625.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9657\" alt=\"DSC_0625\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0625.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis red 180, was killing it on entires all day long, and even got a couple nice reverse entries in as well. I meant to go ask him what setup he was using for knuckles, but I totally forgot. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0656.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9662\" alt=\"DSC_0656\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0656.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's a couple nicer panned out shot of Emily doing her thing. I was pretty surprised when she said this was only her 6th time actually driving here.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0729.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9674\" alt=\"DSC_0729\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0729.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0733.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9676\" alt=\"DSC_0733\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0733.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis red Silvia was also super clean as well..hopefully he never crashes it. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0751.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9681\" alt=\"DSC_0751\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0751.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFinally got an action shot of the nismo inspired 180 from earlier!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0759.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9684\" alt=\"DSC_0759\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0759.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI forgot who was driving this Toyota Supra, but it sounded AMAZING.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0786.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9689\" alt=\"DSC_0786\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0786.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were a number of guys from the shop Red-K as well sporting their signature red overalls, and this sweet looking R34.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0789.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9692\" alt=\"DSC_0789\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0789.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI figured it would be a cool to get shot of my helmet from pit wall. :p\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0793.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9695\" alt=\"DSC_0793\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0793.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nDaigo and the Drift Muscle 180 were really going at it towards the end there, and I also managed to capture Robbie Nishida in a picture. haha I managed to talk with him for a bit, and he's a really cool guy. I'll look forward to meeting up with him again when him and his Achilles team come to Seattle for Formula Drift!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1216.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9712\" alt=\"IMG_1216\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1216.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter about 6 hours of what seemed like non-stop driving, people finally started packing up to head home. Notice the super legid trailer in the back that's carrying the Thailand D1 Altezza and Daigo Saito's missle.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0794.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9696\" alt=\"DSC_0794\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0794.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I thought was hilarious was this s13,  which was originaly white, but had been painted black.

So, I decided to make the 2.5hr trip up there for the first time to check it out! It's worth noting before I start, that halfway throughout the even, I realized my camera settings were totally jacked up. &gt;&lt; so, some of the pictures came out wayy too light. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0481.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9616\" alt=\"DSC_0481\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0481.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>At first I really didn't feel like going just because I had previously went to the same area in Tochigi for Tsukuba just a few days earlier. But, then I remembered how much crap I would've gotten had I not gone. :p So, I grabbed a few things at the convenience store before heading out in the morning. On thing I noticed is that the Pringles here in japan taste totally different! they're less salty. My friend Shunji in seattle is ALWAYS buying pringles, so I guess thats why. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9709\" alt=\"IMG_1207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_1207-e1369444714318.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I started off with taking the shinkansen from Tokyo Station. Turns out I had about 30minutes to kill before my train, so I did a bit of exploring outside the station. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9463\" alt=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00301.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There was this cool courtyard area with small waterfalls that I ran into.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9472\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00411.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I didn't want to wander too far, so I just posted up on this street corner to see if I could snap any cool things that drove by. :p Sadly, there was nothing that exciting, and after a while I made my way back to the train station.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9476\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00451.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I always forget to take pictures of are these JR ticket machines. They're really easy to use in both japanese and english. You can also recharge your SUICA card here, which is basically like a rechargable card. I finally decided to get one this time around, and its much easier than dealing with a bunch of tickets.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9483\" alt=\"DSC_0056\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0056.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>If I haven't already mentioned it....there's a TON of people here in tokyo. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9484\" alt=\"DSC_0057\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00571.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Inside the station, they have another special gate for the shinkansen, with people to help you out so you don't end up on the wrong train or something. lol</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9486\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0059.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After being on the train for a couple hours, I finally arrived at Utsunomiya, and was suprised with how many taxi's were lined up outside. Luckily, I happened to pick the perfect one!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9490\" alt=\"DSC_0065\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0065.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Along the way, I had a great conversation with Yama-san about various things about the US and Japan. He was even nice enough to cut my fare off early, and I only paid part of what I was really supposed to! ^_^ Between the shinkansen and the taxi fare I was supposed to pay, you're looking at around $100 just to get to Nikko Circuit. Sadly, Yama-san doesn't use facebook, or mail or anything, but hopefully he enjoys reading this! Also, he recently had a baby 3 months ago, so congratulations to him!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9492\" alt=\"DSC_0067\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0067.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When I first walked into the area, I was a bit shocked to believe I was actually AT Nikko. The one thing I also enjoyed, is unlike events in the US. It's FREE to come and hangout in the pits, and watch the event. You only pay if you're going to be driving. Also, the prices on food/dinks weren't hiked up, and were actually super cheap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9493\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This super clean Nismo styled 180 caught my attention</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9494\" alt=\"DSC_0069\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0069.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also, here's one of the Wind's Auto owned R32's</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9497\" alt=\"DSC_0072\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_00721.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>a quick shot looking back on the part of the pit area</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9498\" alt=\"DSC_0073\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0073.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There certainly were some unusual drift cars out there today, like this SW20.

Andy and Team Orange Driver Naoto Suenaga are the ones who gave me pointers when I attended the Team Orange Drift School last year!

Luckily, Emilys blue one was still up and running strong. So, I was able to get some ride along footage with her at the bottom of this post!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0351\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0351.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0349\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0349.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0791\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0791.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that I noticed on alot of the cars, especially S-chassis, was the very simple mods. Brakes were pretty much stock, with upgraded pads. However, the one thing I did notice, is people actually spent money on quality parts like JIC, DG5, Tomei, ProjectMu, ect.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9552\" alt=\"DSC_0280\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0280.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This s14 took me back to the early 2000's for some reason. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9560\" alt=\"DSC_0303\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0303.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>These 86's sounded super awesome flying by as well. It's funny when you stop and think that these only have 1.6L compared to the 2.xL of other motors like RB's, JZ's, ad SR's out on the track.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9566\" alt=\"DSC_0321\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0321.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>quick shot back at the entrance area</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9576\" alt=\"DSC_0350\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0350.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This pretty clean Bilstein 86 was also doing some laps. Although it seemed like he wasn't going very hard on it. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9585\" alt=\"DSC_0371\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0371.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Just because it's a new car, that doesn't stop some people though apparently! 0_o</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9586\" alt=\"DSC_0372\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0372.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While I was on my way to go watfch some more action from the other side of the track, some body came pulling up with their bumper dragging along....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9592\" alt=\"DSC_0393\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0393.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>oh hey, look!

So, all of the drivers went out to help cleanup the mess. This is the one big difference I notice even on Drift Tengoku videos. In the US, we had set corner workers that do this, and the drivers end up just relaxing. But, its kind of nice to see most of the drivers all pitching in to do their part in fixing up the track.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9595\" alt=\"DSC_0397\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0397.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They also had this mini street sweeper thing come in to spread out some of the powder, which is used to suck up some of the oil spilled on the track.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9597\" alt=\"DSC_0401\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0401.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, it seemed like the track turned into a rally stage! 0_o</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9598\" alt=\"DSC_0402\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0402.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Even though they could barely see anything, people were charging flat out into the first corner!! haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9600\" alt=\"DSC_0409\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0409.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Some people like this guy were even getting some nice weight transfer going on before the flick to get it sideways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9604\" alt=\"DSC_0423\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0423.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, these guys started getting some pretty good tandem battles going lap after lap</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9614\" alt=\"DSC_0465\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0465.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I noticed this SW20/MR2 pulled into the pits, so I went to take a picture of its awesome Pedo Bear sticker. :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9615\" alt=\"DSC_0478\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0478.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>They also started getting some good drift trains going on with daigo leading the pack.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9620\" alt=\"DSC_0486\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0486.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Except someting looked a tad off....but I couldn't quite figure out what it was... :p</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9625\" alt=\"DSC_0505\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0505.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Shortly after, the MR2 also joined in on the fun</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9629\" alt=\"DSC_0522\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0522.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I didn't catch this miata running much, but it seemed really simple and well done.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9630\" alt=\"DSC_0527\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0527.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here Emily and Andy go out for another sesstion. It was really interesting riding in her car. It feels soo different compared to drifting my s13. Due to the amount of weight, and wheelbase, and how you can see the suspensio is setup with a really slow rebound in the rear, it had a really nice squat to it when going through the corner. This also gave it a ton of front grip as well it felt like. I can see why alot of D1 setups have been switching to using something similar like this now!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9634\" alt=\"DSC_0537\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0537.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Another quick shot from the front of this Drift Muscle 180!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9642\" alt=\"DSC_0567\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0567.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Emily using some front brake action on corner entry!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0584.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9645\" alt=\"DSC_0584\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0584.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>More of the usual, This Toyota Altezza just eating pavement for lunch breakfast and dinner! &gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0625.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-9657\" alt=\"DSC_0625\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0625.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This red 180, was killing it on entires all day long, and even got a couple nice reverse entries in as well.

So, I was able to go for 3 weeks instead of the normal 2. :p\r\n\r\nAnywho, I set out from Seattle and landed at Haneda around 11:30pm. My friend Wataru and his wife Azusa were picking me up from some station over near Ibaraki. Which meant I had to transfer about 2 different times, all while hauling all my crap (suitcase, backpack, duffle bag, and a smaller suitcase). Luckily, I barely made my last transfer and arrived at the station on-time. The problem however, is I didn't yet have my rental sim card, and no wi-fi. So, I had no way to really get in touch with him. Also, he failed to tell me that this station unlike most country-side ones, has multiple exits. So, after the station started closing and I wandered around trying to get wi-fi for like an hour before finally just using my roaming with Verizon.\r\n\r\nOnce he arrived, he told me his place was too small so we were gonna try and find a hotel for me, but it was too late at night, and check-in as long overdue for most places. Sooo, both him and his wife looked at each other and said \"I guess all that's left is a Love Hotel\". If you don't know what that is, do some google'ing. :p Anyways, once we got to the place we were like crap...who is gonna be the one to go with me to see if there was a room available. As funny as it was, his wife made Wataru go with me. So, basically 2 dudes walked into a love hotel, saw it was way too expensive for just one night, and left. haha\r\n\r\nIn the end, I ended up sleeping in their car at the Convenience Store next to their place. :p Not the most comfortable, but it was fine for just one night. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2121.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10652\" alt=\"IMG_2121\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2121.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\nThe following day, we got me checked into pretty cool older-style hotel with tatami floormats. Wataru had work and Asuza had some stuff to do, so I had a free day to wander until later that afternoon.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0005.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10533\" alt=\"DSC_0005\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0005.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10531\" alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0004.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>I started off by walking around, to see what I can find, and surprisingly, this is what I run into...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0006.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10532\" alt=\"DSC_0006\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0006.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>There was this super clean 86 sitting there, on what looked some tiny shop.

The owner was actually super surprised that A) somebody non-japanese walked in and B) I spoke pretty fluent japanese. haha I ended up getting some free ice cream which was really nice of him!\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0025.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10545\" alt=\"DSC_0025\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0025.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0023.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0023\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0023.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2124.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10650\" alt=\"IMG_2124\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2124.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn the way back to my hotel I spotted some cool cars hiding around :p\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0026.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10544\" alt=\"DSC_0026\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0026.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0027.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10546\" alt=\"DSC_0027\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0027.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0028.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10547\" alt=\"DSC_0028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0028.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nSo, fast forward to the next day and friend Hideki from Garage Miura, and Suzuki-san from Orange Planning were going to be driving in the 86 Festival over at Tsukuba Circuit. Since Wataru is a friend of his, and also drives 86's, the plan was to head over there with Azusa who also drives an S14 Silvia. Before they came to get me, I made sure to get my fill of morning sentai tv shows! haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10653\" alt=\"IMG_2126\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10654\" alt=\"IMG_2128\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter Wataru came to get me from the Hotel, we headed back to his place to get Azusa. I was able to meet his brother and mom, and also snap some pics of their rides, and an evil kitty. lol\r\n\r\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"4\" ids=\"10549,10548,10550,10551,10552,10553,10554,10555,10556,10557\"]\r\nWe then made our way over to Tsukuba Circuit which was about 15 minutes away. At the entrance, we ran into once of Azusa's friend's s13.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0041.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10558\" alt=\"DSC_0041\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0041.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs we headed into the circuit, there was also all the normal assortment of crazy 86's. It is interesting seeing some of the US style and parts coming over to japan now. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0047.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10564\" alt=\"DSC_0047\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0047.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10565,10566,10567,10562,10561,10559,10560,10622,10621,10563\"]\r\n\r\nOnce inside, we started searching for Hideki amogst the masses of 86's!\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0058.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10570\" alt=\"DSC_0058\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0058.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nfor some reason, the blue pearl-ish of this one really stood out to me!\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0060.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10571\" alt=\"DSC_0060\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0060.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe finally tracked him down after a few minutes, just as they were about to head out for Qualifying.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0062.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10573\" alt=\"DSC_0062\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0062.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>We also found Suzuki-san next to him in he grid in the orange/black coupe.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0158.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10599\" alt=\"DSC_0158\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0158.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0065.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10576\" alt=\"DSC_0065\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0065.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nwhile they were running Qualifying, I headed off to check out some other cars. Lots of famous 86's were there such as CBY, Tec-Arts, Tsuchiya's personal car, and the TRD N2 racecar. The TRD car specifically was really clean and had some crazy looking headers.\r\n\r\n[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10577,10575,10578,10568,10607,10606,10597,10598,10600,10605,10609,10608,10580,10579,10604,10601,10602\"]\r\n\r\nAfter qualifying, it was time to snap shot shots of the main race. Hideki was able to win his class, but I wasn't able to get go-pro footage. So, luckily Hideki took some for me with his own camera. :p<a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0092.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10586\" alt=\"DSC_0092\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0092.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0103.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10587\" alt=\"DSC_0103\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0103.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YFtJq0rTjxg\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.mkimg.carview.co.jp/minkara/userstorage/000/012/919/929/297912fd39.jpg\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" />\r\n\r\nAfterwards there was a pretty cool drift demo, and it was nice to see drifting back at Tsukuba after D1 left here years ago!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0195.jpg\">\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10615\" alt=\"DSC_0195\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0195.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0193.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10616\" alt=\"DSC_0193\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0193.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>Lastly the main event was the N2 race.

So, see you again Tsukuba Circuit!\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0234.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10619\" alt=\"DSC_0234\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0234.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>We first headed up what was called the \"Purple Line\" of Mt.Tsukuba. This is the place in Initial D where God Hand and God Foot race at actually. haha There were already a few people up there enjoying the view as well.[gallery columns=\"4\" ids=\"10623,10624,10625,10626,10628,10627\"]\r\nOn the way back down, we stopped off at the Tsukubajinja shrine, which was actually pretty amazing.

Since Wataru is a friend of his, and also drives 86's, the plan was to head over there with Azusa who also drives an S14 Silvia. Before they came to get me, I made sure to get my fill of morning sentai tv shows! haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10653\" alt=\"IMG_2126\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2126.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10654\" alt=\"IMG_2128\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2128.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After Wataru came to get me from the Hotel, we headed back to his place to get Azusa.

Lots of famous 86's were there such as CBY, Tec-Arts, Tsuchiya's personal car, and the TRD N2 racecar.

Somehow, Ken thought putting Queso Cheese dip, and Flamin Hot Cheetos together was the best thing since sliced bread. Sadly, his stomach thought otherwise later. haha\r\n\r\nWhile in Tokyo, I made it a priority to visit as many people as I could. Since I was only there for a little under a week and had been there before. So, first person up on my hit list was my friend Teppei.

First stop was a place that was actually right next to the hotel I usually stay at in Meguro called Hungry Heaven. I've seen the sign a number of times walking by it, but i've never actually gone inside until now. haha The bugers are a bit expensve, but definitely tastey!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2188.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10687\" alt=\"IMG_2188\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2188.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2186.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10689\" alt=\"IMG_2186\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2186.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI totally forget where we went to after that since its been nearly 3-4 months after the fact, but this is what you end up dealing with in Tokyo...:( PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. this is the main reason I prefer quieter, countryside places. Cities have never really been my thing. lol\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10690\" alt=\"IMG_2185\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2185.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0002.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10736\" alt=\"DSC_0002\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0002.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile wandering around these things drove by..half mech half woman??<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2190.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10685\" alt=\"IMG_2190\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2190.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe Spotted this awesome tower in the distance, and thought it would be great to get some shots from there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10734\" alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0004.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nSome of these buildings gave me vertigo just looking at them. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0007.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10732\" alt=\"DSC_0007\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0007.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0009.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10730\" alt=\"DSC_0009\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0009.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe finally got to the top(52nd floor I believe), and busted out the cameras. The crazy part was you can actually feel the building sway. I guess due to the earthquakes, its neccessary. I just thought it was interested, since its totally different compared to some of the bigger buildings in seattle.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10721\" alt=\"DSC_0024\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10723\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThere were some really great views from up there, and its kind of mind blowing just how dense Tokyo is. You don't really get the big picture from the street, but once you go higher up like this, its pretty crazy.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0018.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10725\" alt=\"DSC_0018\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0018.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0010.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10729\" alt=\"DSC_0010\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0010.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nStill feeling pretty Energetic, I hopped on the train to Yokohama to visit my friend Derek again. Since, I had some time to kill, I wandered around, and found this place! :p<a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0319.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10754\" alt=\"DSC_0319\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0319.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Nissan Global Headquarters and Gallery Showroom!!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0339.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0339\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0339.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere were mostly newer cars there, this didn't stop anybody from admiring great cars like the new 2014 GTR V-Spec, and 370Z convertible.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0308.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10759\" alt=\"DSC_0308\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0308.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0281.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10782\" alt=\"DSC_0281\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0281.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" />\r\n</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0283.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0283\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0283.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThey had this cool timeline things, that routed all over the showroom.

It was short, and I mainly was just hanging out with friends most of the time. haha This post was a bit short on car content, so sorry if it was a bit boring. lol I've got some good stuff coming up from Shizuoka and Fuji Speedway next. So, lets see if I can manage to upload that stuff quicker than a month this time around! :p heh","html":"<p>hey guys,</p>\n\n<p>Still working on trying to get this blog train rolling. Life has been hectic, so sorry for the slowness! :\\ Anyways, lets pick up where we left off. The first section of my trip involved being up in Tsukuba for a few days.

This time, it was a bit closer towards Shinjuku which was nice. Aside from the occaisional wierdness like this, it wasn't all that bad and I had a great time! haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0273.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10785\" alt=\"DSC_0273\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0273.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2161.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10711\" alt=\"IMG_2161\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2161.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>My one condition for staying there was that I had to bring back some various snacks that you can't find in Japan. Somehow, Ken thought putting Queso Cheese dip, and Flamin Hot Cheetos together was the best thing since sliced bread. Sadly, his stomach thought otherwise later. haha</p>\n\n<p>While in Tokyo, I made it a priority to visit as many people as I could. Since I was only there for a little under a week and had been there before. So, first person up on my hit list was my friend Teppei.

The crazy part was you can actually feel the building sway. I guess due to the earthquakes, its neccessary. I just thought it was interested, since its totally different compared to some of the bigger buildings in seattle.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10721\" alt=\"DSC_0024\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0024.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"410\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10723\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0021.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"936\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>There were some really great views from up there, and its kind of mind blowing just how dense Tokyo is.

It was originally owned by my fried Joe, who was running it in his S14. However, after that got totalled out, he remembered I was looking for an SR to swap in soon, and cuz me an amazing deal. Some things already done to the motor when I got it were:\r\n-Eagle rods\r\n-CP Pistons(86.5mm)\r\n-Apexi Headgasket(87x.8mm)\r\n-APR Headstuds\r\n-Greddy Rocker Arm Stoppers\r\n-Garage Autohero Engine Balancing and Head Port\r\n-Nismo FPR and Nismo 550cc injectors\r\n-Nismo Waterpump\r\n-S15 T28 Turbo\r\n-Megan Racing Exhaust Manifold\r\n-Noname downpipe elbow\r\n-Apexi AFC Neo\r\n-Spec Stage 3 full-sprung 6-puck clutch\r\n-Fidanza Flywheel\r\n\r\nSince Joe's car was currently sitting at my friend Ricky's shop, so was the motor after it was pulled. One weekend I had some freetime, and figured I'd better start working on tearing everything down. So, I went to pick it up, and take the motor and tranny down to my house.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10829\" alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nLiterally that following week, the thermostat on my KA got stuck, and while trying to limp my car home while overheating the headgasket gave out..:( It wasn't the best motor, and had its annoying times, but I had no major issues with it, and it had served me well since 2007!\r\n\r\nSo, now without having a car and taking the train to work and I finally got going on things with the SR. First, I needed to go pickup an engine stand so I had something to work on. lol\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10870\" alt=\"1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext I got the motor all strapped up, and over to the stand.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10871\" alt=\"1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"474\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nAfter getting all the turbo side stuff removed, it was time to clean things up a bit. Here's a quick before shot.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10842\" alt=\"1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\naaand the after\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10841\" alt=\"1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne things were all clean I started getting the turbo side pieced back together. Replacing the T28 turbo was this shiney guy. A brand new Garrett GTX2867r .64A/R. This turbo is essentially a middle step between Garrett's famous GT2871r and GT3076. The problem you're faced with these two turbo's, is you're forced to make a choice. go for low-end power, but quick spool and response. Or, deal with more turbo lag, and more top end power, but longer spool and response.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10833\" alt=\"gtx3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhile still being a bottom mounted T2 series turbo, it certain has its limitations, like interal wastebate, and maybe not making as much top end power as the T3 series. But, you'll be surprised when you see the numbers later on. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10834\" alt=\"gtx4\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo make sure I was getting the most out of this turbo, I contacted the guys over at DOC Race since they're relatively local, and seem to do great work! They offer a bottom mount style T2 series manifold that's hand made, but also an external wastegate flange! This will allow me to more reliably run higher levels of boost, without chances of leaks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10872\" alt=\"T25-Mock-up-1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10873\" alt=\"T25-Mock-up-2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"340\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10827\" alt=\"doc3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow, when converting internal wastegate over to internal, alot of people weld the flapper shut. But, if i'd like to sell this turbo in the future, that might be an issue. So, I did some searching and turns out they make a locker bracket for this type of things over at COBB Tuning for Subaru's. I don't have a Subaru, but a turbo is a turbo, regardless of the car its on.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10828\" alt=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing however, is I never got a e-clip with this turbo since it was new, and I tried finding some different ones at Ace Hardware, but didn't have any luck. I did pick up some of these little metal clips, and they seem to be doing just fine after 3 months.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10838\" alt=\"998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nPicked up this Copper style gasket<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10874\" alt=\"IMG_1900\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI got everything bolted up to check clearances and lines<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10844\" alt=\"1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThe wastegate i'm running is a Tial MVS w/ v-band flanges\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10823\" alt=\"249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOne interesting piece I later found out, is According to <a title=\"Tial's website\" href=\"http://www.tialsport.com/documents/MVSspc.png\">Tial's website</a>. This combination of Black and Red springs should equal 1bar(roughly 14.5psi). However, turns out for some reason, this is actually 1.37bar(20psi). haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10845\" alt=\"1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">I then got everything mocked up to make sure it would fit. I was originally a bit concerned with the dump pipe clearing the steering column, and would later make some small adjustments.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10853\" alt=\"1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1455148_10202036532462329_1711768617_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor exhaust related pieces, I decided to go with the Powered by MAX Cobra Downpipe. This makes the turbo elbow and downpipe all into one piece, while adding a flex section. The one thing I didn notice with this is you ABSOLUTELY must run the transmission bracket for the downpipe or else your exhaust is going to sag alo!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10830\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe buddy club exhaust sounded great(being able to hear my turbo through exhaust is the best sound in the world). but the fitment left a bit to be desired, and I needed something just a tad quieter since I still daily my car. So, I went back to the old trust Megan Racing Drift Spec that I had on my KA for about 5 years, this time in a 3\" for the SR.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10859\" alt=\"1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow on to some misc intake and exhaust related things. I picked up this Stance oversized water pump pulley since I know SR's are notorious for overheating. I also picked up this neat Mishimoto radiator cap that also has a temp guage in it, which has proved very userful. Also a HKS SSQV blowoff valve, which sounds great!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10837\" alt=\"misc_intake\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a>\r\nGot the Greddy Type-LS front mount all mocked up. I have to say, comparing this to other kits such as CX racing and other off brand ones, paying the extra bit of money to have the fitment be dead on is totally worth it! haha The only thing I had to do with this kit was drill out the hole in the battery tray!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10855\" alt=\"1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a>\r\nI did have to remove my front bumper support. Since I don't have the proper tools to cut the USDM one, i'll either do it later, or try to pick up a JDM one. ;)Also, its worth noting, I had to trim a few plastic pieces off the back of the type-x bumper, but nothing too crazy.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10856\" alt=\"995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really wanted to do was keep this car reliable. So, instead of fully building the head, I decided to just keep the internals stock, and upgradae the cams to Jim Wolf Technology S3HL cams.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10836\" alt=\"IMG_1681\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I found helped out alot when doing this, was just zip tying the chain to the sprocket so my timing didn't get out of place. Then, to prevent the sprockets from falling down too far into the motor, I just put a socket extention down the hole to block things.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10875\" alt=\"IMG_1941\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nGot everything apart, and inspecting stuff for any issues/wear<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10847\" alt=\"1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere you can see the lobe difference compared to stock which feature a 272 Duration, and an uncommon 11.5mm of lift. This will prevent me from being forced to the solid lifters like with most 12mm setups.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10890\" alt=\"1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nStaying with the head side of things, one common issue I've seen alot of with S13 valve covers, is oil blowby. So, I decided to pick up this S13.4 valve cover. The front half is s13, the rest is s14 due to it having better oil baffles in the valve cover.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10848\" alt=\"1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo make things cleaner I picked up this Tomei spark plug cover, and also some other misc parts like heater core conversion hoses, since I daily this car and would like heat during the winter time. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10843\" alt=\"1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLastly, I picked up this Radium Engineering catch can to filter out all the crap before it goes into my turbo. I'm not running it at the moment, since I still need to pickup some more AN fittings and line, but i'm looking forward to seeing how much it picks up.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10893\" alt=\"1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow, lets move over to Fuel/Engine Mgmt! The harness I'm running is Chase Bays and to be honest, had less than stellar quality with them. I'll explain a bit later on that though.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10835\" alt=\"IMG_1676\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"474\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's one thing I noticed right off the bad. when installing my Power Enterprises 850cc injectors.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10825\" alt=\"599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere you can see the normal SR injector plug, with these offset slots. however...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10888\" alt=\"IMG_2029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe injectors I got came with the slots even with each other. This is different compared to the old Nismo injectors I pulled, which were offset like the plug.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10889\" alt=\"IMG_2028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe fix I did for this was to just bust out a file, and grind down one side of the injector the following two directions.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10887\" alt=\"IMG_2030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10886\" alt=\"IMG_2031\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce its ground down like this, the plug fits right on with no issues. I might throw some zipties or something around these though going forward. Since, after doing some doughnuts recently, I had one of my injectors pop off.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10885\" alt=\"IMG_2032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10884\" alt=\"IMG_2033\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10883\" alt=\"IMG_2034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor Boost Levels and A/F's I'm running AEM Tru-Boost and AEM EUGO gauges. There's a few advantages to this. With the Tru-Boost gauge, it also doubles as a boost controller while providing a few options such as scramble boost(not using this quite yet, but might in the future), and over boost detection(kick down to wastegate pressure if it detects boost pressure getting too high). Also, the EUGO controller, allows me to run A/F data directly to the gauge, then from there send it to my ECU. Also, FYI I not running a MAF setup since its relatively old technology, and I figured its smarter and more reliable to go with a MAP setup. So I picked up an AEM 3bar MAP and IAT sensor.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10891\" alt=\"aem-gauges\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI ended up just running this dual-gauge pillar. However, I ran my wires a bit differently than most. Instead of cutting/drilling into my dash or pillar, I simply disconnected the plastic hose behind my cluster, and ran the wires up through the vent!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\">\r\n</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_20140329_162357.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_20140329_162357\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_20140329_162357.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTo make life easier and add flexibility later down the road, I picked up a full standalone EMS series 2 ECU from AEM. I debated picking up haltech, but a majority of tuners in my area can do AEM. So, that was the difference maker, aside from the various plug-n-play sensors and gauges.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10826\" alt=\"AEM-EMS2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing worth noting, is with the AEM ECU, you also need to run the CAS trigger wheel they supply with it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10840\" alt=\"1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt some point(this is 4 months afterwards) I made the call to start pulling the trusty old KA, and drop in the SR.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10849\" alt=\"996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne thing I sort of forgot to do, was plug the back of the transmission..&gt;&lt; the result was a lake of tranny fluid all over my garage floor. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10850\" alt=\"1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI then got the front stuff of the motor wrapped up with the Stance pulley and GKtech fan for more colling. One thing I later found out, is once that nismo thermostat kicks open, its a bit difficult to get any heat in this thing. haha I'll report back how things are after some track days. but, so far for daily driving anyways, it takes quite a while to warm up, and is only at the first bar on the stock temp gauge. I'll probably pick up an aftermarket water and oil temp gauge shortly as well.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10839\" alt=\"1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10854\" alt=\"1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFor even more cooling, I picked up this Koyo radiator.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10894\" alt=\"1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWith the KA out, I figure it was a good time to cleanup my engine bay. Sadly, it instantly got just as dirty right away, so that as a bit of a waste. I really need to plug the big holes near the firewall..:\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10851\" alt=\"1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's the overall finished product!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10858\" alt=\"995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor my battery I just ran this little Odyssey battery, and seems to be fine as long as I fire up the car once every other day. If it goes more than a full day, it will go dead. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10910\" alt=\"10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI threw in this bottle until I could get my intake piping for the turbo made. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10882\" alt=\"IMG_2035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOnce I had the SR in, I did notice a few clearance things. First off, the space for the wastegate is pretty cramped, but looks just barely clears. I rubbed it up against the firewall when I dropped the motor in, so that's what the mark is from.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10880\" alt=\"IMG_2004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10881\" alt=\"IMG_2003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe other issue, is dealing with the dump pipe. Taking this thing on/off is seriously a huuuge pain, and I actually had to have the pipe angled down to a 45 degree angle, instead of a 90 for more clearance for the steering rack and because it was hitting up against the brake booster. My one gripe right now, is its not long enough, and could use another 45 degree bend at the end, and a straight section so it blows more towards the back end of the steering rack and not directly on it so much.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2016.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10897\" alt=\"IMG_2016\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2016.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2017.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10898\" alt=\"IMG_2017\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2017.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter finally getting everything in and buttoned up, I seemed to have a pretty annoying issue. The car had fuel and compression while cranking over, but absolutely ZERO spark. I went through all the basics and was pulling my hair out. I was about to leave to japan in a matter of a few weeks, so I called up Alex over at <a title=\"Carb Connection\" href=\"http://www.carbconn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carb Connection</a> to see if he could sort the car out for me while I was on vacation. luckily, he obliged, and I arranged for Yuki to get towed down to their shop.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467473_10202217306221560_1399847473_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10864\" alt=\"1467473_10202217306221560_1399847473_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467473_10202217306221560_1399847473_n.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis post is already getting a bit long, so i'll continue things in part 2! :)","html":"<p>Over the past 6-9 months i've been saving and piecing together parts for Yuki's new engine. Naturally, its only fitting that the platform is a SR20DET blacktop from a 1997 180sx Type-X. :p</p>\n\n<p>With that said, lets kick things off so I can start going over what's all there and how the build went!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10833\" alt=\"gtx3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>So, lets first start of with the motor itself. It was originally owned by my fried Joe, who was running it in his S14. However, after that got totalled out, he remembered I was looking for an SR to swap in soon, and cuz me an amazing deal. Some things already done to the motor when I got it were: <br />\n-Eagle rods\n-CP Pistons(86.5mm)\n-Apexi Headgasket(87x.8mm)\n-APR Headstuds\n-Greddy Rocker Arm Stoppers\n-Garage Autohero Engine Balancing and Head Port\n-Nismo FPR and Nismo 550cc injectors\n-Nismo Waterpump\n-S15 T28 Turbo\n-Megan Racing Exhaust Manifold\n-Noname downpipe elbow\n-Apexi AFC Neo\n-Spec Stage 3 full-sprung 6-puck clutch\n-Fidanza Flywheel</p>\n\n<p>Since Joe's car was currently sitting at my friend Ricky's shop, so was the motor after it was pulled. One weekend I had some freetime, and figured I'd better start working on tearing everything down. So, I went to pick it up, and take the motor and tranny down to my house. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10829\" alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_00151.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Literally that following week, the thermostat on my KA got stuck, and while trying to limp my car home while overheating the headgasket gave out..:( It wasn't the best motor, and had its annoying times, but I had no major issues with it, and it had served me well since 2007!</p>\n\n<p>So, now without having a car and taking the train to work and I finally got going on things with the SR. First, I needed to go pickup an engine stand so I had something to work on. lol <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10870\" alt=\"1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1385931_10201869345802767_117216144_n1.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Next I got the motor all strapped up, and over to the stand.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10871\" alt=\"1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382038_10201889444785229_1545787858_n1.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"474\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>After getting all the turbo side stuff removed, it was time to clean things up a bit. Here's a quick before shot. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10842\" alt=\"1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1378820_10201896048910328_2085892229_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>aaand the after <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10841\" alt=\"1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1381260_10201896048510318_1600460480_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One things were all clean I started getting the turbo side pieced back together. Replacing the T28 turbo was this shiney guy. A brand new Garrett GTX2867r .64A/R. This turbo is essentially a middle step between Garrett's famous GT2871r and GT3076. The problem you're faced with these two turbo's, is you're forced to make a choice. go for low-end power, but quick spool and response. Or, deal with more turbo lag, and more top end power, but longer spool and response.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10833\" alt=\"gtx3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx3.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While still being a bottom mounted T2 series turbo, it certain has its limitations, like interal wastebate, and maybe not making as much top end power as the T3 series. But, you'll be surprised when you see the numbers later on. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10834\" alt=\"gtx4\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gtx4.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To make sure I was getting the most out of this turbo, I contacted the guys over at DOC Race since they're relatively local, and seem to do great work! They offer a bottom mount style T2 series manifold that's hand made, but also an external wastegate flange! This will allow me to more reliably run higher levels of boost, without chances of leaks.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10872\" alt=\"T25-Mock-up-1\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10873\" alt=\"T25-Mock-up-2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/T25-Mock-up-2.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"340\" /></a> <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10827\" alt=\"doc3\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/doc3.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, when converting internal wastegate over to internal, alot of people weld the flapper shut. But, if i'd like to sell this turbo in the future, that might be an issue. So, I did some searching and turns out they make a locker bracket for this type of things over at COBB Tuning for Subaru's. I don't have a Subaru, but a turbo is a turbo, regardless of the car its on.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10828\" alt=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0001.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing however, is I never got a e-clip with this turbo since it was new, and I tried finding some different ones at Ace Hardware, but didn't have any luck. I did pick up some of these little metal clips, and they seem to be doing just fine after 3 months.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10838\" alt=\"998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/998583_10202076921912040_1907308151_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Picked up this Copper style gasket<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10874\" alt=\"IMG_1900\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1900.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I got everything bolted up to check clearances and lines<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10844\" alt=\"1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393141_10201963129427299_622385445_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>The wastegate i'm running is a Tial MVS w/ v-band flanges</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10823\" alt=\"249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/249058_10200901766893899_385651218_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>One interesting piece I later found out, is According to <a title=\"Tial's website\" href=\"http://www.tialsport.com/documents/MVSspc.png\">Tial's website</a>. This combination of Black and Red springs should equal 1bar(roughly 14.5psi). However, turns out for some reason, this is actually 1.37bar(20psi). haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10845\" alt=\"1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1390749_10201963129667305_1860647357_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">I then got everything mocked up to make sure it would fit.

This makes the turbo elbow and downpipe all into one piece, while adding a flex section. The one thing I didn notice with this is you ABSOLUTELY must run the transmission bracket for the downpipe or else your exhaust is going to sag alo!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10830\" alt=\"DSC_0059\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0059.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0077\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0077.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The buddy club exhaust sounded great(being able to hear my turbo through exhaust is the best sound in the world). but the fitment left a bit to be desired, and I needed something just a tad quieter since I still daily my car. So, I went back to the old trust Megan Racing Drift Spec that I had on my KA for about 5 years, this time in a 3\" for the SR.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10859\" alt=\"1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1939849_10202769916196464_1605512305_n.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now on to some misc intake and exhaust related things. I picked up this Stance oversized water pump pulley since I know SR's are notorious for overheating. I also picked up this neat Mishimoto radiator cap that also has a temp guage in it, which has proved very userful. Also a HKS SSQV blowoff valve, which sounds great!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10837\" alt=\"misc_intake\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/misc_intake.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a> <br />\nGot the Greddy Type-LS front mount all mocked up. I have to say, comparing this to other kits such as CX racing and other off brand ones, paying the extra bit of money to have the fitment be dead on is totally worth it! haha The only thing I had to do with this kit was drill out the hole in the battery tray!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10855\" alt=\"1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1472893_10202059900566517_87237495_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a> <br />\nI did have to remove my front bumper support. Since I don't have the proper tools to cut the USDM one, i'll either do it later, or try to pick up a JDM one. ;)Also, its worth noting, I had to trim a few plastic pieces off the back of the type-x bumper, but nothing too crazy.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10856\" alt=\"995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995874_10202059900686520_1944868206_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that I really wanted to do was keep this car reliable. So, instead of fully building the head, I decided to just keep the internals stock, and upgradae the cams to Jim Wolf Technology S3HL cams. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10836\" alt=\"IMG_1681\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1681.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I found helped out alot when doing this, was just zip tying the chain to the sprocket so my timing didn't get out of place. Then, to prevent the sprockets from falling down too far into the motor, I just put a socket extention down the hole to block things.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10875\" alt=\"IMG_1941\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1941.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Got everything apart, and inspecting stuff for any issues/wear<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10847\" alt=\"1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1459838_10202013135557421_1909890702_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here you can see the lobe difference compared to stock which feature a 272 Duration, and an uncommon 11.5mm of lift. This will prevent me from being forced to the solid lifters like with most 12mm setups.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10890\" alt=\"1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456008_10202013135117410_1060685775_n1.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>Staying with the head side of things, one common issue I've seen alot of with S13 valve covers, is oil blowby. So, I decided to pick up this S13.4 valve cover. The front half is s13, the rest is s14 due to it having better oil baffles in the valve cover. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10848\" alt=\"1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1392506_10202013135877429_1583442436_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To make things cleaner I picked up this Tomei spark plug cover, and also some other misc parts like heater core conversion hoses, since I daily this car and would like heat during the winter time. haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10843\" alt=\"1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1422609_10201956041170097_418257809_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I picked up this Radium Engineering catch can to filter out all the crap before it goes into my turbo. I'm not running it at the moment, since I still need to pickup some more AN fittings and line, but i'm looking forward to seeing how much it picks up.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10893\" alt=\"1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463743_10202059901406538_69209440_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now, lets move over to Fuel/Engine Mgmt! The harness I'm running is Chase Bays and to be honest, had less than stellar quality with them. I'll explain a bit later on that though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10835\" alt=\"IMG_1676\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_1676.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"474\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's one thing I noticed right off the bad. when installing my Power Enterprises 850cc injectors.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10825\" alt=\"599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/599214_10200481601990039_715089067_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here you can see the normal SR injector plug, with these offset slots. however...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10888\" alt=\"IMG_2029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2029.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The injectors I got came with the slots even with each other. This is different compared to the old Nismo injectors I pulled, which were offset like the plug.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10889\" alt=\"IMG_2028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2028.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The fix I did for this was to just bust out a file, and grind down one side of the injector the following two directions.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10887\" alt=\"IMG_2030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2030.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10886\" alt=\"IMG_2031\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2031.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once its ground down like this, the plug fits right on with no issues. I might throw some zipties or something around these though going forward. Since, after doing some doughnuts recently, I had one of my injectors pop off.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10885\" alt=\"IMG_2032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2032.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10884\" alt=\"IMG_2033\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2033.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10883\" alt=\"IMG_2034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2034.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For Boost Levels and A/F's I'm running AEM Tru-Boost and AEM EUGO gauges. There's a few advantages to this. With the Tru-Boost gauge, it also doubles as a boost controller while providing a few options such as scramble boost(not using this quite yet, but might in the future), and over boost detection(kick down to wastegate pressure if it detects boost pressure getting too high). Also, the EUGO controller, allows me to run A/F data directly to the gauge, then from there send it to my ECU. Also, FYI I not running a MAF setup since its relatively old technology, and I figured its smarter and more reliable to go with a MAP setup. So I picked up an AEM 3bar MAP and IAT sensor. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10891\" alt=\"aem-gauges\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I ended up just running this dual-gauge pillar. However, I ran my wires a bit differently than most. Instead of cutting/drilling into my dash or pillar, I simply disconnected the plastic hose behind my cluster, and ran the wires up through the vent!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/aem-gauges.jpg\"> <br />\n</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_20140329_162357.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_20140329_162357\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_20140329_162357.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To make life easier and add flexibility later down the road, I picked up a full standalone EMS series 2 ECU from AEM. I debated picking up haltech, but a majority of tuners in my area can do AEM. So, that was the difference maker, aside from the various plug-n-play sensors and gauges.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10826\" alt=\"AEM-EMS2\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AEM-EMS2.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing worth noting, is with the AEM ECU, you also need to run the CAS trigger wheel they supply with it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10840\" alt=\"1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1394452_10201896048150309_1647155935_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At some point(this is 4 months afterwards) I made the call to start pulling the trusty old KA, and drop in the SR.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10849\" alt=\"996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/996948_10202020502621593_1922096383_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One thing I sort of forgot to do, was plug the back of the transmission..&gt;&lt; the result was a lake of tranny fluid all over my garage floor. haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10850\" alt=\"1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1467410_10202020502981602_1852439716_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I then got the front stuff of the motor wrapped up with the Stance pulley and GKtech fan for more colling. One thing I later found out, is once that nismo thermostat kicks open, its a bit difficult to get any heat in this thing. haha I'll report back how things are after some track days. but, so far for daily driving anyways, it takes quite a while to warm up, and is only at the first bar on the stock temp gauge. I'll probably pick up an aftermarket water and oil temp gauge shortly as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10839\" alt=\"1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1382023_10201896047310288_2140500384_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10854\" alt=\"1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1456537_10202036532662334_1393823390_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>For even more cooling, I picked up this Koyo radiator.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10894\" alt=\"1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1463108_10202068268335706_1260657950_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>With the KA out, I figure it was a good time to cleanup my engine bay. Sadly, it instantly got just as dirty right away, so that as a bit of a waste. I really need to plug the big holes near the firewall..:\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10851\" alt=\"1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1471232_10202026446930197_1414901273_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here's the overall finished product!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10858\" alt=\"995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/995541_10202068268735716_976887063_n.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For my battery I just ran this little Odyssey battery, and seems to be fine as long as I fire up the car once every other day. If it goes more than a full day, it will go dead. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10910\" alt=\"10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10151408_10203000897010840_531142455_n.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I threw in this bottle until I could get my intake piping for the turbo made. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10882\" alt=\"IMG_2035\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2035.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once I had the SR in, I did notice a few clearance things. First off, the space for the wastegate is pretty cramped, but looks just barely clears. I rubbed it up against the firewall when I dropped the motor in, so that's what the mark is from.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10880\" alt=\"IMG_2004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2004.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"355\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10881\" alt=\"IMG_2003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2003.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The other issue, is dealing with the dump pipe. Taking this thing on/off is seriously a huuuge pain, and I actually had to have the pipe angled down to a 45 degree angle, instead of a 90 for more clearance for the steering rack and because it was hitting up against the brake booster. My one gripe right now, is its not long enough, and could use another 45 degree bend at the end, and a straight section so it blows more towards the back end of the steering rack and not directly on it so much.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2016.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10897\" alt=\"IMG_2016\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2016.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2017.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10898\" alt=\"IMG_2017\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_2017.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"632\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After finally getting everything in and buttoned up, I seemed to have a pretty annoying issue. The car had fuel and compression while cranking over, but absolutely ZERO spark. I went through all the basics and was pulling my hair out.

area and swapped places so I could drive.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2229.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10980\" alt=\"IMG_2229\"

Everytime I go there, its to meetup with Hideki who helps his dad run Garage Miura which specializes in AE86's, Mini's, Daihatsu's and tons of other small/kei cars. I metup with him and his sister Yukako at Sawayaka who later introduced me to their friend Yuya and his wife(whos name I cant remember).\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10984\" alt=\"1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"717\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Hamburger there never dissappoints, and I can't wait to go back again this year in 2014! ^_^ oh, they give you those paper \"shields\" to prevent the grease from splashing on you. lol\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10964\" alt=\"IMG_2196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Hideki had to head up to the shop to prepare for a race in Tsukuba  in a couple days. On the way, we stopped off at a gift shop, and there was a group of these awesome Soarers chilling outside.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10933\" alt=\"DSC_0025\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBack at Hachi Roku HQ, I started taking more pics. Even though this is my 3rd time, I still have an awesome time visiting there.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0028.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10936\" alt=\"DSC_0028\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0028.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" />\r\n\r\n</a>Yuya also gave me some....unusual chocolate. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2203.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10971\" alt=\"IMG_2203\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2203.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere's always interesting stuff laying around. Such as this cool 4AG Supercharger which I assume is off of an AW-11 motor.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10935\" alt=\"DSC_0027\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nOr these kouki lips\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2202.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10970\" alt=\"IMG_2202\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2202.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI also spotted this super old school Apexi AFC device. I forget what car it came off of, but apparently the thing still works from what Hideki tells me.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0027.jpg\">\r\n</a><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2201.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10969\" alt=\"IMG_2201\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2201.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" />\r\n\r\n</a>That same blue levin is still sitting there...hopefully somebody buys it eventually..;) haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0030.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10938\" alt=\"DSC_0030\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0030.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nup above that is Hideki's dad's car, which is super clean<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0029.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10937\" alt=\"DSC_0029\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0029.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" />\r\n\r\n</a>I was even surprised with the underbody.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0033.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10940\" alt=\"DSC_0033\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0033.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe recently put a wing on his own 86 to get better downforce at Tsukuba. But, opposite to how I feel, his somewhat dislikes 86's with wings. So, after the tsukuba event, its coming off. haha\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10939\" alt=\"DSC_0032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTowards the back there's a nice collection of exhausts hanging around.\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10941\" alt=\"DSC_0034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBack towards the front you can see all the goodies lining the walls. I still wonder sometimes how the heck they got that red car in there. lol <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0026.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10934\" alt=\"DSC_0026\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0026.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were heading off for Fuji Speedway to go watch Hideki's friend do some drifting!

I metup with him and his sister Yukako at Sawayaka who later introduced me to their friend Yuya and his wife(whos name I cant remember). <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10984\" alt=\"1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1524662_628796410499489_1661179558_n.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"717\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The Hamburger there never dissappoints, and I can't wait to go back again this year in 2014! ^_^ oh, they give you those paper \"shields\" to prevent the grease from splashing on you. lol <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10964\" alt=\"IMG_2196\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2196.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>After dinner Hideki had to head up to the shop to prepare for a race in Tsukuba  in a couple days. On the way, we stopped off at a gift shop, and there was a group of these awesome Soarers chilling outside. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10933\" alt=\"DSC_0025\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0025.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Back at Hachi Roku HQ, I started taking more pics.

But, opposite to how I feel, his somewhat dislikes 86's with wings. So, after the tsukuba event, its coming off. haha <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10939\" alt=\"DSC_0032\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0032.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Towards the back there's a nice collection of exhausts hanging around. <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10941\" alt=\"DSC_0034\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0034.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Back towards the front you can see all the goodies lining the walls.

This place called Smile(スマイル) apparently is pretty famous, and is only found here in shizuoka. You can get Udon, Onigiri and Coffee for only ￥３００($3.00USD)! <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10996\" alt=\"IMG_2207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2207.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" />\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast it was off to Fuji!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_2208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWhen we first got there, I was pretty surprised at just how many 4-doors there were. Apparently this trend has been getting popular lately in Japan, but since our 4door cars in the US are crap, its not quite the go-to option for drifting.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11035\" alt=\"DSC_0037\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nMore chaser goodness<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11029\" alt=\"DSC_0044\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nA bit farther down, this pinked out s14 was driven by a girl of course. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11025\" alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe later caught up with Hideki's friend Kodai driving this white AE86.

Kodai looks indecisive since pretty much everything at these little shacks tastes awesome and its not very expensive either! I ended up eating a crepe and some curry rice. To everyone's surprise, the crepe was first. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10990\" alt=\"IMG_2214\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHideki couldn't resist taking some shots to post up over on his <a href=\"http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Minkara Blog</a>.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10989\" alt=\"IMG_2215\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nTalk about having a professional cameraman pose! :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11009\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI decided it was my turn to try taking some fancy pictures.

So, I tagged along for a ride.<a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0082.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0082\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0082.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>The morning started off pretty early with Hideki stopping by the hotel to come pick me up.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2204.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10998\" alt=\"IMG_2204\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2204.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>After that it was off to grab some food before heading up to Fuji Speedway. This place called Smile(スマイル) apparently is pretty famous, and is only found here in shizuoka. You can get Udon, Onigiri and Coffee for only ￥３００($3.00USD)! <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10996\" alt=\"IMG_2207\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2207.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></p>\n\n<p>After breakfast it was off to Fuji!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_2208\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2208.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When we first got there, I was pretty surprised at just how many 4-doors there were. Apparently this trend has been getting popular lately in Japan, but since our 4door cars in the US are crap, its not quite the go-to option for drifting.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11035\" alt=\"DSC_0037\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0037.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /> <br />\n</a></p>\n\n<p>More chaser goodness<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11029\" alt=\"DSC_0044\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0044.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A bit farther down, this pinked out s14 was driven by a girl of course. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11025\" alt=\"DSC_0048\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0048.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We later caught up with Hideki's friend Kodai driving this white AE86. I'll post video I took down towards the bottom of the page.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0042.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11031\" alt=\"DSC_0042\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0042.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2209.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10994\" alt=\"IMG_2209\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2209.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Also another one of their friends was driving this blue silvia.<a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0043.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11030\" alt=\"DSC_0043\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0043.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2211.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10992\" alt=\"IMG_2211\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2211.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This 86 was also killing it all day which I later found out was one of the Run-Free guys!<a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0058.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0058\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0058.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0052.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11021\" alt=\"DSC_0052\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0052.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After the morning session, we headed over back towards the main circuit area to get some food. Kodai looks indecisive since pretty much everything at these little shacks tastes awesome and its not very expensive either! I ended up eating a crepe and some curry rice. To everyone's surprise, the crepe was first. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10990\" alt=\"IMG_2214\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2214.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Hideki couldn't resist taking some shots to post up over on his <a href=\"http://minkara.carview.co.jp/en/userid/764570/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Minkara Blog</a>.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10989\" alt=\"IMG_2215\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2215.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Talk about having a professional cameraman pose! :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11009\" alt=\"DSC_0068\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0068.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I decided it was my turn to try taking some fancy pictures. I think they came out looking okay.<a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0061.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11014\" alt=\"DSC_0061\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0061.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0062.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11013\" alt=\"DSC_0062\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0062.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0063.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11012\" alt=\"DSC_0063\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0063.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a><a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0064.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11011\" alt=\"DSC_0064\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0064.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After lunch it was back to the pit area to do some more scouting.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0049.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11024\" alt=\"DSC_0049\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0049.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Hideki later intoduced me to the guy putting on the event for day, Koichi Urushibara. he's was super nice and we talked about all sorts of things about the US and Japan. When I told him, he could easily sell that car for around 12k in the US, he was pretty surprised. haha His car was running great, and I got quite a surprise when he popped the hood...<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0045.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11028\" alt=\"DSC_0045\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0045.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Vmount, and lots of other goodies that I don't see most SR's in japan with! I wish my engine bay was this clean.

Since Hideki was off to Tsukuba after this, we all headed out to get dinner before parting.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0083.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10999\" alt=\"DSC_0083\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0083.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We went to this Family Resteraunt called COCO's.

So, I put my rusty playing skills to the test for a bit.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11173\" alt=\"1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1517694_582189125190576_981072782_n.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe took a short drive over to Nara park to go checkout the crazy deer they have there.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2266.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11146\" alt=\"IMG_2266\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2266.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere's some video of us getting attacked by the deer. lol You can buy Senbei(crackers) at the entrance, and feed them to the deer as you go deeper into the park.

One highlight of the night, was when her grandma kept asking to get hooked up with my dad. &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2308.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_2308\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2308.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The next morning, I set out to do some exploring since I finally had some downtime.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0001.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11107\" alt=\"DSC_0001\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0001.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing that can get very confusing, is the multiple exists at trainstations. This happens to be simple since its a small one. But, in some of the bigger ones, you have multiple numbered exits for West, East, South, and North exits.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0003.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11108\" alt=\"DSC_0003\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0003.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I hopped on the train over to Q's mall near Tennoji Station to see what was going on. <a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0004.jpg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0004\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0004.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The weather was great, but I wasn't able to find anything interesting really..<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0005.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11110\" alt=\"DSC_0005\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0005.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Spotted this cool Subie Forester with some PIA rack lights<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0010.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11113\" alt=\"DSC_0010\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0010.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And this classic Toyota Celica<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0008.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11112\" alt=\"DSC_0008\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0008.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I then decided to walk down along the street since I saw there was some park/zoo thing off in the distance to the left.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0011.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11114\" alt=\"DSC_0011\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0011.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It kind of amazes me how japan is able to keep these railways so clean and well maintained. We just have one in seattle, and its ALWAYS dirty. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0014.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11116\" alt=\"DSC_0014\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0014.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Making my way....over that way. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0012.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11115\" alt=\"DSC_0012\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0012.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Once I got there, this wierd pigeon was marching around like he was in the military. so...I snapped a quick shot. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_00261.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11122\" alt=\"DSC_0026\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_00261.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I do like about japan in general, is how much awesome architecture there is, and how it blends old with new stuff. Like this clock, with an older castle in the background.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0015.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11117\" alt=\"DSC_0015\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0015.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This zoo/park thingy was wierd. You had to pay to go inside...but it was all fake animals. haha I guess that's one way to keep cost down <em>shrugs</em><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0021.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11119\" alt=\"DSC_0021\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0021.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I snapped some more shots of builders while making my way back.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0022.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11120\" alt=\"DSC_0022\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0022.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"715\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I got vertigo just looking UP at them. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2240.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11131\" alt=\"IMG_2240\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2240.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the few times I ate mcdonalds over in japan. The french fries tasted a bit less salty, but other than that...things were pretty much the same for the mcdouble and the quarter pounder. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2313.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11171\" alt=\"IMG_2313\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2313.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, I headed out to get some night shots and enjoy the scenery.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2289.jpg\"><img alt=\"IMG_2289\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2289.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It wasn't a very clear night, so I had a difficult time shooting stuff up at this lookout area.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0117.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11124\" alt=\"DSC_0117\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0117.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I really need to work on my night photography..:\\<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11125\" alt=\"DSC_0118\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DSC_0118.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I headed up to Kyoto to meetup with my friend Yukari and grab some dinner at this little Izakaya place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2280.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11151\" alt=\"IMG_2280\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_2280.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I forget all of what I ate, but this sashimi was bomb! <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2282.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11177\" alt=\"IMG_2282\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2282.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the way back, I made a quick pitstop to say hi to my friend Akane while she was working her part-time job at this english pub.

Enjoy!\n\nI took the long train ride from Osaka all the way up to Maebashi in Gunma and metup once again with my good friend Eichi who runs the Gunma chapter of <a href=\"http://www.re-sanai.com/\">Garage Re-Sanai</a>. He surprised me with a new car he picked up which was sporting a very nice wing. :p\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2314.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11241\" alt=\"IMG_2314\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2314.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nAfter heading back to drop off my things, and relax a bit, we went over to see our friend Yuya for dinner who runs a local Ramen Shop I've covered before called Menya Gekkou(麺屋月虹)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2316.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11239\" alt=\"IMG_2316\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2316.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nTo be honest I don't even remember what I ordered since its now 6 months after the fact. But, I do remember it being awesome!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2317.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11238\" alt=\"IMG_2317\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2317.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nThe next day for lunch I ate...yep, ramen! This place was within walking distance from Eichi's place.\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2357.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11202\" alt=\"IMG_2357\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2357.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nThere were surprisingly a decent number of people there for it to have been morning. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2356.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11203\" alt=\"IMG_2356\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2356.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nAfter lunch, we realized this was my 3rd time in japan and I still haven't been to an onsen. So, we headed up into the hills to this place that was maybe 15min away. If you have time, I totally reccomend checking one out. Feels great on a cold winter day! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2325.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11231\" alt=\"IMG_2325\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2325.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nAfter the Onsen, we stopped by Okada's pudding/cake shop Crayon. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2318.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11237\" alt=\"IMG_2318\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2318.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nAs always, everything tasted AMAZING. I keep trying to confince him to open up a Seattle branch, but no luck so far. :p<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2319.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11236\" alt=\"IMG_2319\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2319.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nOkada-san had some time after work, so he joined us for some all-you-can-eat ShabuShabu.\n\n<a style=\"line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2327.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11229\" alt=\"IMG_2327\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2327.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\nThe next morning, Eichii invited me to go with him down to Tokyo with his co-workers for New Years stuff over at the temple. I stopped this super clean R33 on the way heading out of Gunma.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2355.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11204\" alt=\"IMG_2355\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2355.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nOne thing I finally realized, its a pain to find street parking in tokyo with lowered cars. Those big green blocks that you park on are pretty annoying. lol<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2332.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11224\" alt=\"IMG_2332\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2332.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nTurns out, there's a TON of people that like going to temples around this time of the year. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2333.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11223\" alt=\"IMG_2333\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2333.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nApparently, i'm supposed to have a really good year, and got the best out of all the fortunes which is DaiKichi(大吉). So far (Beginning of May), Things are going well. we'll see how the rest of the year goes. lol\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2334.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11222\" alt=\"IMG_2334\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2334.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nAfterwards everyone went to get lunch at this awesome Hot Pot place. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2336.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11220\" alt=\"IMG_2336\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2336.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a> <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2339.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11218\" alt=\"IMG_2339\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2339.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nGetting gas on the way back to Gunma. roughly $74 bucks for 12 gallons of 100 octane gas! ouch! &gt;&lt;<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2342.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11216\" alt=\"IMG_2342\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2342.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nOnce back in Gunma we metup with Eichii's friend Hideki to get ramen again. :p hopefully you see a trend here. haha\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2346.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11212\" alt=\"IMG_2346\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2346.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\nHideki also owns an FD and was nice enough to let my take it for a spin! Before this, I had never driven a Turbo car before. So, it made me look forward to having my SR running even more! lol\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2348.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11210\" alt=\"IMG_2348\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2348.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2351.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11207\" alt=\"IMG_2351\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2351.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" /></a>\n\nThe next and last day of my stay we headed up so I could do some shopping.<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2362.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11197\" alt=\"IMG_2362\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2362.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a>\n\nPicked up a Baby Metal CD I was having some trouble finding back in Seattle!\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2364.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11195\" alt=\"IMG_2364\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2364.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>\n\nAfterwards we still had a bunch of time to kill so Eichii remembered there was a car museum not too far away called the Yokota Car &amp; Doll Museum. ohhh man, was I in for a surprise. lol\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1506325_10202556160892715_1288207795_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11247\" alt=\"1506325_10202556160892715_1288207795_o\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1506325_10202556160892715_1288207795_o.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a>\n\nI'm getting lazy, so i'm just post up everything below. There were a TON of awesome cars here and old school stuff. but the thing that most caught my eye was the small Initial D section they setup. The actual Tofu store was torn down a few years ago. So, its nice to see this small corner dedicated to it. lol\n\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1559486_10202556165892840_1257607924_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large

catch my flight back to seattle..:( I'll be taking another trip towards the end of may. But, I'm not sure how much of it i'll document this time. These things are getting time consuming...or i'm getting lazier...or both! haha\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2378.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11187\" alt=\"IMG_2378\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2378.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a>","html":"<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1511678_10202556160252699_1971534311_o.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-11243\" alt=\"1511678_10202556160252699_1971534311_o\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1511678_10202556160252699_1971534311_o.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"313\" /></a> <br />\nhey guys,</p>\n\n<p>Here's the final part of my Winter 2013 Japan trip! Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>I took the long train ride from Osaka all the way up to Maebashi in Gunma and metup once again with my good friend Eichi who runs the Gunma chapter of <a href=\"http://www.re-sanai.com/\">Garage Re-Sanai</a>. He surprised me with a new car he picked up which was sporting a very nice wing. :p <br />\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2314.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11241\" alt=\"IMG_2314\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2314.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After heading back to drop off my things, and relax a bit, we went over to see our friend Yuya for dinner who runs a local Ramen Shop I've covered before called Menya Gekkou(麺屋月虹)<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2316.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11239\" alt=\"IMG_2316\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2316.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To be honest I don't even remember what I ordered since its now 6 months after the fact. But, I do remember it being awesome!<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2317.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11238\" alt=\"IMG_2317\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2317.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The next day for lunch I ate...yep, ramen! This place was within walking distance from Eichi's place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2357.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11202\" alt=\"IMG_2357\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2357.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There were surprisingly a decent number of people there for it to have been morning. haha<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2356.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11203\" alt=\"IMG_2356\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2356.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"816\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After lunch, we realized this was my 3rd time in japan and I still haven't been to an onsen. So, we headed up into the hills to this place that was maybe 15min away. If you have time, I totally reccomend checking one out. Feels great on a cold winter day! ^_^<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2325.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11231\" alt=\"IMG_2325\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2325.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After the Onsen, we stopped by Okada's pudding/cake shop Crayon. <a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2318.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11237\" alt=\"IMG_2318\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_2318.jpg\" width=\"816\" height=\"612\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As always, everything tasted AMAZING.

I went down a few days ago and finally bought the paint for her. The paint is Nissan paint code LP2. Which is called Midnight Purple, Cabernet, or Deep Metallic Purple depending on where you live at. lol this paint came on the R33 Nissan Skyline, Sentra, and 300zx. well, anyways tell me what you guys think. The purple has a blue pearl in it to give it that color shift depending on how the light hits it.

I went down a few days ago and finally bought the paint for her. The paint is Nissan paint code LP2. Which is called Midnight Purple, Cabernet, or Deep Metallic Purple depending on where you live at. lol this paint came on the R33 Nissan Skyline, Sentra, and 300zx. well, anyways tell me what you guys think. The purple has a blue pearl in it to give it that color shift depending on how the light hits it. However, it’s a pretty dark purple. at night it’ll look black pretty much, then depending on how the sun hits it.

It was funny though that in both Seattle, and LAX, TSA people couldn't figure out what the hell my helmet+camera gear bag was. lol LAX was especially funny since my camera badgcombined with the camera mount in the next pouch almost looked like a gun in the scanner. &gt;_&lt; haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7098\" title=\"IMG_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198-e1337511635164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter possibly the worst and most grueling flight EVAR in my life(16 total hours), I arrived to jdm land at last! overall the fact that I was in tokyo didn't quite hit me until a bit later since at the time above it was 5:30am and the airport was pretty dead. Sadly, I had to sit around and wait for that Softbank Place to open at 0630 so I could get my japanese sim card + phone number.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that I ran into Super GT300 Driver Mitsuhiro Kinoshita(Also driver of the WTAC Hankook FD3S). When I asked him if he was Kinoshita-san from Rev Speed and the Hankook FD3S he just replied with \"Sorry, no English.\" so...yeah that was a little disheartening. Since either he was a DEAD look alike, or it had to be him. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7099\" title=\"IMG_0199\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199-e1337511883189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter picking up my sim card, and exchanging my cash money into Yen(stupid exchange rates..T_T) it was time to figure out how to hell I was going to get to my hotel.  I knew roughly that I had to get to Hamamatsu-cho, and then hop on the JR Yamanote line to get to Meguro which is where my hotel is at.After talking to this lady at the information booth, she said I needed to take the Monorail to get to me to Hamamatsu-cho.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7100\" title=\"IMG_0200\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200-e1337512016681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nLuckily almost all of the signs had english,hiragana, and kanji written on them. So, I at least had a 2/3 chance of being able to read it and figure out where I needed to go. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7102\" title=\"IMG_0205\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205-e1337512133588.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBy this point, I managed to succefully take my first public method of transport into the heart of tokyo. The monorail was pretty dead since it was super early on a sunday morning. But, I was curious when I switched over to the JR Yamanote Line how busy and difficult it would be. Turns out, transferring and using the JR railway overall is a breeze! The ticketing system confused the hell out of me at first, but after the first couple times it made sense.(I totally forgot to get a picture of the ticket machine, so I'll do that tomorrow :p). Anyways, as you can see.....it was pretty dead early in the morning. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7103\" title=\"IMG_0206\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206-e1337512574579.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI managed to brave the worst of my fears so far, and got off at the correct stop. Then, I sort of had to judge where certain streets where based off what I remembered looking at from google maps. My phone has data disabled(cuz its hella expensive), so I didn't have any maps to tell me exactly where the hotel was. Here's an super clean Subaru WRX(GC8) that I saw on the way to the hotel.

Luckily, I understand japanese better than speaking it because that one person who knew english took off while I was waiting for check in time. So, the girl came around the corner at noon letting me know my room was ready, and needed to go over a few things with me. Apparently, like the trains, everything gets shutdown at midnight here. So, she was telling me that to get into the elevator area I needed to also use my key card if its between 12-6. Overall the staff here are super helpfull, and she even complimented me on my Dragon Ball Z t-shirt. ^_^\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0213.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7110\" title=\"IMG_0213\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0213.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nfinally.....A BED!!!!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0214.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7111\" title=\"IMG_0214\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0214-e1337513853132.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe bathroom is pretty cool. It was a recessed floor. So, if you spill water all over the place, it just goes to the drain there under the sink. another thing I liked is they provided bodywash+shampoo in the dispencer thingys. I forgot mine at home, so this was awesome. lol Also, that toilet scared the bejesus out of me. It was one of those built in bidet/butt washer things along with a seat warmer. All of these seemed pretty creepy, and I luckily figured out how to disable them all. lol I like my toilets how I like my revenge. COLD!\r\n\r\nI finally managed to get all my crap sorted out luggage wise, and hop online to send out my \"I'm still alive emails\". Shortly after that one of my previous co-workers who was now living in tokyo gave me a call saying he had church in shibuya(2 stops away from me) from 1-4pm and wanted to meetup for dinner. My eyes were pretty bloodshot from not getting ANY sleep on the flight over here, so I told him to give me a call once his church stuff got out. This enabled me to at least get a few hours of naptime in, before heading out again.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7112\" title=\"IMG_0216\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne thing I still wasn't sure about fully, was buying train tickets. For my monorail I just chose the monorail+JR Yamanote line button for 500Yen. This time, however there was no button for which specific stop I wanted to go to. There were only faires along with some other misc options. Not realizing there's a chart right effing above my head showing what fares to use to get to a specific station, I just picked 540Yen, and embarked to shibuya. I later found out, that getting to shibuya only requires 150yen...so yeah. lesson learned. lol\r\n\r\nAnyways, I was supposed to meet my friend Yoshi at the Hachiko statue outside of Shibuya station which is a really popular meetup spot. Little did I know, is that its on the east exit of the station. Being my normal stupid self, I exited on the west side and wandered around for a while before finally giving him a quick call.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7113\" title=\"IMG_0217\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217-e1337514586460.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe were going to get sushi, but the place he normally ate at was closed due to repairs. So, we went to this awesome Yakiniku place called Toraji located in the Palco shopping centre.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7115\" title=\"IMG_0220\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nYoshi in all his glory. I like the fact they gave us those aprons to prevent spilling stuff on our shirts. Also, like a few japanese places in Seattle, it looks like no matter where you go, you get something to clean your hands with before the meal. I think its really cool, and wish more places over stateside did the same.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7116\" title=\"IMG_0221\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221-e1337514836746.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHere on the menu they explain all the different cuts of meat, and where they come from. We ended up getting the Toraji Assortment to the right there along with some Salad that was actually really good. It had was really good and had some light tasting type of dressing on it similar to what you get a teriyaki places.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7117\" title=\"IMG_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOM NOM NOM NOM. The meat was seriously amazing. It was super soft, and falls apart in your mouth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7119\" title=\"IMG_0224\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224-e1337515129926.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a>\r\n\r\nNext up was a short walk down the street over to another shopping centre(forgot the name) for some desert. It had tons of stuff in the lower levels like phones+accessories(yes a whole floor dedicated to that),appliances, TVs, and video games. At the top we came a place called Nishimura Fruits Parlour.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7118\" title=\"IMG_0223\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMy inner Gintoki was not dissappointed, and this Strawberry+Bannana parfait was really good. As you can see, I started tearing through it, then realized I needed to take a picture. haha\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7120\" title=\"IMG_0225\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHeading back to the train station, I saw this epic MIB3 banner. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7121\" title=\"IMG_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nI remembered I forgot to grab a picture of my station, so I did so on the way home from dinner. The ticket machines I talked about are to the left there. You tend to get a bit stressed out if you've never used them before, because people are waiting in line behind you. lol\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7122\" title=\"IMG_0227\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nHorrible shot of the main street outside of the Meguro station that leads down to the hotel\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7123\" title=\"IMG_0229\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMy last mission for the night was figuring out how the hell to get this A/C thing working &gt;_&lt; all the buttons were in kanji. So some guess work, and a quick google search helped me get the thing running properly.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7127\" title=\"IMG_0232\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnyways, that's about it for my first day here.I'll leave you with a view from my hotel at night before hitting the sack in a few minutes. Plans for tomorrow are to head out to Gunma in the morning to go tour around with my friend Eichi and also check out his Rotary tuning shop Complete Garage Re-Sanai. So, hopefully I can get there without taking the wrong train to somewhere :p\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","html":"<p>Day 1 of my japan trip is under wraps!

It was funny though that in both Seattle, and LAX, TSA people couldn't figure out what the hell my helmet+camera gear bag was. lol LAX was especially funny since my camera badgcombined with the camera mount in the next pouch almost looked like a gun in the scanner. &gt;_&lt; haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7098\" title=\"IMG_0198\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0198-e1337511635164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After possibly the worst and most grueling flight EVAR in my life(16 total hours), I arrived to jdm land at last! overall the fact that I was in tokyo didn't quite hit me until a bit later since at the time above it was 5:30am and the airport was pretty dead. Sadly, I had to sit around and wait for that Softbank Place to open at 0630 so I could get my japanese sim card + phone number.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that I ran into Super GT300 Driver Mitsuhiro Kinoshita(Also driver of the WTAC Hankook FD3S). When I asked him if he was Kinoshita-san from Rev Speed and the Hankook FD3S he just replied with \"Sorry, no English.\" so...yeah that was a little disheartening. Since either he was a DEAD look alike, or it had to be him. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7099\" title=\"IMG_0199\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0199-e1337511883189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>After picking up my sim card, and exchanging my cash money into Yen(stupid exchange rates..T_T) it was time to figure out how to hell I was going to get to my hotel.  I knew roughly that I had to get to Hamamatsu-cho, and then hop on the JR Yamanote line to get to Meguro which is where my hotel is at.After talking to this lady at the information booth, she said I needed to take the Monorail to get to me to Hamamatsu-cho.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7100\" title=\"IMG_0200\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0200-e1337512016681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Luckily almost all of the signs had english,hiragana, and kanji written on them. So, I at least had a 2/3 chance of being able to read it and figure out where I needed to go. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7102\" title=\"IMG_0205\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0205-e1337512133588.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By this point, I managed to succefully take my first public method of transport into the heart of tokyo. The monorail was pretty dead since it was super early on a sunday morning. But, I was curious when I switched over to the JR Yamanote Line how busy and difficult it would be. Turns out, transferring and using the JR railway overall is a breeze! The ticketing system confused the hell out of me at first, but after the first couple times it made sense.(I totally forgot to get a picture of the ticket machine, so I'll do that tomorrow :p). Anyways, as you can see.....it was pretty dead early in the morning. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7103\" title=\"IMG_0206\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0206-e1337512574579.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I managed to brave the worst of my fears so far, and got off at the correct stop.

This enabled me to at least get a few hours of naptime in, before heading out again.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7112\" title=\"IMG_0216\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0216.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One thing I still wasn't sure about fully, was buying train tickets. For my monorail I just chose the monorail+JR Yamanote line button for 500Yen. This time, however there was no button for which specific stop I wanted to go to. There were only faires along with some other misc options. Not realizing there's a chart right effing above my head showing what fares to use to get to a specific station, I just picked 540Yen, and embarked to shibuya. I later found out, that getting to shibuya only requires 150yen...so yeah. lesson learned. lol</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I was supposed to meet my friend Yoshi at the Hachiko statue outside of Shibuya station which is a really popular meetup spot. Little did I know, is that its on the east exit of the station. Being my normal stupid self, I exited on the west side and wandered around for a while before finally giving him a quick call.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7113\" title=\"IMG_0217\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0217-e1337514586460.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We were going to get sushi, but the place he normally ate at was closed due to repairs. So, we went to this awesome Yakiniku place called Toraji located in the Palco shopping centre.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7115\" title=\"IMG_0220\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0220.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Yoshi in all his glory. I like the fact they gave us those aprons to prevent spilling stuff on our shirts. Also, like a few japanese places in Seattle, it looks like no matter where you go, you get something to clean your hands with before the meal. I think its really cool, and wish more places over stateside did the same.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7116\" title=\"IMG_0221\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0221-e1337514836746.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here on the menu they explain all the different cuts of meat, and where they come from. We ended up getting the Toraji Assortment to the right there along with some Salad that was actually really good. It had was really good and had some light tasting type of dressing on it similar to what you get a teriyaki places.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7117\" title=\"IMG_0222\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0222.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>OM NOM NOM NOM. The meat was seriously amazing. It was super soft, and falls apart in your mouth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7119\" title=\"IMG_0224\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0224-e1337515129926.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"826\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Next up was a short walk down the street over to another shopping centre(forgot the name) for some desert. It had tons of stuff in the lower levels like phones+accessories(yes a whole floor dedicated to that),appliances, TVs, and video games. At the top we came a place called Nishimura Fruits Parlour.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7118\" title=\"IMG_0223\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0223.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>My inner Gintoki was not dissappointed, and this Strawberry+Bannana parfait was really good. As you can see, I started tearing through it, then realized I needed to take a picture. haha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7120\" title=\"IMG_0225\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Heading back to the train station, I saw this epic MIB3 banner. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7121\" title=\"IMG_0226\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0226.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I remembered I forgot to grab a picture of my station, so I did so on the way home from dinner. The ticket machines I talked about are to the left there. You tend to get a bit stressed out if you've never used them before, because people are waiting in line behind you. lol</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7122\" title=\"IMG_0227\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0227.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Horrible shot of the main street outside of the Meguro station that leads down to the hotel</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7123\" title=\"IMG_0229\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0229.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>My last mission for the night was figuring out how the hell to get this A/C thing working &gt;_&lt; all the buttons were in kanji. So some guess work, and a quick google search helped me get the thing running properly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7127\" title=\"IMG_0232\" src=\"http://domofactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_0232.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, that's about it for my first day here.I'll leave you with a view from my hotel at night before hitting the sack in a few minutes. Plans for tomorrow are to head out to Gunma in the morning to go tour around with my friend Eichi and also check out his Rotary tuning shop Complete Garage Re-Sanai. So, hopefully I can get there without taking the wrong train to somewhere :p</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1337491427000,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1399719373000,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1337491427000,"published_by":1},{"id":1858,"uuid":"05301e65-1e99-4257-bb34-9f33d873b423","title":"Yes, i'm still alive and Japan Trip #3!","slug":"yes-im-still-alive-and-japan-trip-3","markdown":"hey everyone,\r\n\r\nsorry for being so dead recently.
